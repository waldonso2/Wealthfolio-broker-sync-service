"""Removes what an installation still holds of brokers this version no longer has.

The test broker "Dummy" (key ``dummy``) existed up to 0.3.6. Its config, saved
credentials and session, sync state, runs, unknown events and holdings check
are removed on the next start. What it booked in Wealthfolio stays - deleting
activities is the user's call; the overview shows once how many there are and
how to find them (comment ``[SYNC dummy:``).
