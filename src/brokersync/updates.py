"""Whether a newer release of the service exists - asked at most once a day, after a run.

Only the redirect of GitHub's ``releases/latest`` page is read (no API, no token, nothing about
the user is sent). The answer is kept in ``meta`` (``UPDATE``); the overview shows a newer
version, and a newly found one is notified once. ``COMPANION_UPDATE_CHECK=0`` turns it off.
Installing is the user's ``update`` in the container's console, or - switched on on the page *Updates* - the
container's own updater (``deploy/companion-autoupdate``, root, every minute), which asks ``due``.
