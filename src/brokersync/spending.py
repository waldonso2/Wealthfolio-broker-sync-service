"""Wealthfolio's spending tracker for the banks it is turned on for (#134, ``BrokerConfig.spending``).

The tracker works per account and categorizes by Wealthfolio's own rules on the activity's note - the
comment the sync writes already names counterparty and purpose, so nothing of an activity changes here.
After each run the cash accounts of those banks are put into the tracked set; one the sync put there
(``meta`` ``spending``) leaves it again when its toggle is off. Accounts the user chose in Wealthfolio
are never removed. Own transfers and securities settlements are linked pairs, which the tracker
counts as saving or neutral, never as spending.
