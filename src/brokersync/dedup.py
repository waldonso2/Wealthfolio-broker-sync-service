"""Finds transactions that are already in Wealthfolio.

Checked against the activities of the broker's accounts:

- **Synced before** (e.g. the sync state was lost or a run was interrupted):
  activities carrying this transaction's ``[SYNC <broker>:<id>]`` reference
  are left to Wealthfolio's own duplicate check - see ``find``.
- **Imported by the Broker Importer addon** from the CSV export or a PDF
  statement: those have other comments and times, so they are matched by
  substance, like the addon's ``matchExisting``: same account and type, at
  most 36 hours apart, same share count (not for dividends) and the same
  amount within 0.02. The security should match too, but the addon books it
  under the ticker the user mapped while the sync uses the ISIN: so a trade
  with a different symbol still matches, a dividend only if it is the only
  candidate. Cash-only activities match on account, type and amount.

Each existing activity matches at most one transaction.
