"""Any bank over FinTS without a profile of its own (#136): bank code and FinTS address are credentials.

Sparkassen, Volks- und Raiffeisenbanken and most other German banks speak FinTS with PIN/TAN.
The standard posting texts of ``FintsAdapter`` apply; giro bookings of depot trades become
``SECURITIES_CASH`` as for DKB. Holdings come over HKWPD when the bank reports a depot, but
they count as incomplete (no ``reports_positions``) until a bank is confirmed.

A few fixed slots, so a user can set up several banks: every key (config, vault, state,
``[SYNC <key>:…]`` references) stays the same for good. Never remove a slot that may be in
use - ``retired`` would have to clean it up.
