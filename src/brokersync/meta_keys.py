"""Every key of the ``meta`` table in ``state.db`` (#77): what it holds and whether it belongs to a broker.

No module builds a ``meta`` key itself - it calls one of these. ``State.forget_broker`` and
``State.reset_broker`` delete the keys of ``BROKER_KEYS`` for a broker.

Kinds: ``flag`` (set or not, value = when it was set), ``text``, ``json``.
