# Changelog

## 0.1.0b1

Features: DKB depot transactions booked, comdirect dividends with their tax, one rule for rate limits, more sector names mapped, asset classes for funds without one.

- Countries & sectors (#166): Finanzfluss' industries Abfallwirtschaft, Bildung, Forsterzeugnisse, Kleidung & Accessoires, Konglomerate, Landwirtschaft, Med. Diagnostik & Forschung and Unternehmensdienste now go to their GICS sector (Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Industrials). Names that are no country or sector (cash and derivatives, "Other", "unbekannt", the pseudo-code XE) are never assigned and listed apart on the service's page as deliberately unassigned; a real country Wealthfolio has no category for (CI, JE) stays listed as without a category.
- Asset classes (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#141, part): every run lists the positions Wealthfolio has no asset class for (its target allocation counts them as "Unknown") on *Prüfung*, with what to do. With *Länder & Sektoren* on, a fund without any asset class whose name Wealthfolio's own rules read as a bond fund or a physical precious-metal ETC gets FIXED_INCOME or COMMODITIES at 100 % with source AUTO, so Wealthfolio's quote provider replaces it; nothing else is inferred, an asset with any asset class (the user's above all) is never touched. The FIRDS fallback of the issue is not built.
- Rate limits (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#149): one shared rule for HTTP 429/503 (`ratelimit.py`). N26, comdirect and Enable Banking read through a short limit (up to three more tries after `Retry-After` or 2/5/15 s, each at most 60 s) instead of failing the broker; logins, token and TAN requests are never repeated. A broker that stays limited (also Trade Republic's `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` and Scalable after its own waits) ends its run as *Abruflimit*, books nothing of it, and scheduled runs wait until the time it named (default 15 minutes, at most a day); ntfy tells it once, the broker card shows it in yellow with the next try. Trade Republic's detail requests are spaced by a short pause.
- DKB (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#130): depot purchases and sales from FinTS (HKWDU, MT536) are booked as `BUY`/`SELL` with their transfer pair, each with the amount of the giro booking that paid it, which is matched in the same run; a fee only where DKB sends a price (sales: fee and tax together). Trades a PDF/CSV import already booked are recognised; trades before the giro history read get `external_cash`; reversals, corporate actions and free deliveries go to *Unbekannt*. Ids `mt536-<day>-<hash>-<n>` (no depot number). Other FinTS banks still only log their depot transactions.
- comdirect (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#52): a dividend gets its tax - withholding tax plus Kapitalertragsteuer, Soli and Kirchensteuer - when its posting text names the gross amount and every tax and they add up to the booked net amount (foreign amounts at the exchange rate named there); otherwise it stays net without tax, nothing is estimated. The amount stays the net payout. Dividends synced before get the tax once: one run reads from the start date again and changes only the `tax` field of the sync's own dividends (flag `own-dividend-tax`).

## 0.1.0a6

Audit and hardening: secrets, web attack surface, workflows and supply chain, container and systemd units.

- Security (#153): forms sent by another website through the browser are refused before any password check - a page elsewhere could else spend the login brake and lock the owner out for 15 minutes.
- Security (#153): the stored Wealthfolio password is only sent to the address it was saved for; a new address needs it typed again (also for *Nur testen*). The ntfy token is dropped when the ntfy server changes, unless a new one is typed. logo.dev redirects only over https.
- Security (#152): broker settings have *Zugangsdaten löschen* - removes the broker's credentials and login session from the vault and switches its fetch off. The ntfy token is masked in the log like the vault's secrets; a damaged unlock cache counts as locked instead of failing every page.
- Tests and docs (#152, #153): table-driven checks over every route (login, CSRF, public allow-list), secret-flow tests (pages, cookie, tracebacks, backup, encryption failures, argon2id cost); findings in docs/SECURITY-AUDIT-0.1.0a6.md.
- Security (#151): least-privilege workflows - write scopes only on the jobs that need them, each commented (`core-watch.yml`'s `issues: write` moved to its job); the release jobs `publish` and `image` run in the environment `release` (protection is a repository setting), releases are queued, never cancelled; no step template-expands a value into a script. `CODEOWNERS` also covers the Dockerfile, the release verifier, `sc_install.py`, the locks and `pyproject.toml`. docs/SECURITY-OPERATIONS.md: workflow inventory, the GitHub settings read on 30.10.2026 (the required-checks list of `main` is empty, no pull-request or tag rule) and the owner's checklist.
- Supply chain (#155): every release carries `sbom.cdx.json` (CycloneDX 1.6 of `requirements.txt`, purls and locked hashes), named in its build-provenance attestation; the image gets BuildKit's SBOM in the registry. pip-audit also checks `requirements-dev.txt`; a test fails on any pip install that bypasses the hash locks; Dependabot updates the Dockerfile's base image digest (both stages now name it in `FROM`). The dependency policy, exceptions table and the gap analysis of waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#150 (a takeover of the GitHub account still produces releases that verify) are in docs/SECURITY-OPERATIONS.md.
- Security (SEC-08, #154): the root units are sandboxed as far as their job allows - the updaters (`wealthfolio-companion-update`, `-update-recover`) get a private `/tmp`, protected kernel tunables, modules, logs, cgroups and hostname, no SUID/SGID files, native system calls, Unix/netlink/IP sockets only and no `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, `CAP_NET_RAW` and other capabilities they never use (`systemd-analyze security` 9.4 → 6.1); the certificate's renewal hides other processes and sends no IP traffic (2.1 → 1.7). `ct/` states the container's settings explicitly (unprivileged, nesting, no FUSE, TUN or GPU). Tests assert every unit's hardening, the scores where systemd is installed, and the modes of data, key and program. docs/OPERATIONS.md describes the trust boundary, every unit's privileges, file modes and the network the service needs.
- The update no longer prints sigstore's "TUF repository is loaded in offline mode" notice onto its progress line; other warnings still show.

## 0.1.0a5

Verified releases: the Proxmox install and every update, and the Docker image, are checked against this repository's signed release workflow before anything of them runs.

- Security: Proxmox install and update verify the release's SLSA build provenance before accepting `SHA256SUMS` - the attestation must come from `release.yml` on `main` (GitHub-hosted runner) and name the downloaded file's SHA-256. No GitHub login: the attestation comes from GitHub's public API and is verified offline with sigstore (`src/brokersync/provenance.py`, in a throwaway venv of the new hash-locked `requirements-verify.txt`; verifier and lock are taken from `main`, like the install script). Any failure stops the install or update; the old version keeps running.
- Security (#146): after the one-line install nothing is fetched from a branch again. `update` in the container runs the installed, verified `companion-update`, which verifies the next release with the installed release's own verifier. Install and update verify the release archive's provenance too, before it is unpacked, and accept only a plain version string. docs/OPERATIONS.md describes the trust chain, its one anchor (the install script from `main`) and how to check the installer against a release first.
- Security (#149): updates are staged and reversible - built in `/opt/wealthfolio-companion/releases/<version>-<id>` while the old version runs, then the data is backed up, the `current` symlink switched, and the service health-checked (`--version`, active, `/healthz`); on failure the previous release and its data are put back automatically (the automatic update reports it via ntfy). One update at a time (lock), never during a sync; an update interrupted by a reboot is undone at the next boot (`wealthfolio-companion-update-recover.service`). A container installed before this version switches to the new layout with its next `update`.
- Docker, Podman, Unraid (#150): the image is run only by a digest whose cosign signature and SLSA provenance were verified for this repository's `release.yml` on `main` - new `scripts/pull-verified-image.sh <version>` (resolves the tag once, refuses `latest`, fails closed and changes nothing on any error). The Compose example needs `COMPANION_IMAGE` (no tag, no default); the README's install, update and restore steps, the *Updates* page and the update notice use it; cosign 3.0.6 install pinned by SHA-256.

## 0.1.0a4

- Documentation: ARCHITECTURE.md is English and describes the current architecture and data flow; the move guide from Wealthfolio Broker Sync is no longer part of the operations guide - it stays in this changelog (0.1.0a1), and the old installer's notice points there.
- Tests: regression cases for matching bank settlements (`ExistingIndex.find_settlement`); a DKB depot test no longer depends on today's date.

## 0.1.0a3

- After a move from Wealthfolio Broker Sync the overview and *Updates* offered its old version (e.g. "Update available: version 0.44.0"): the last update answer came along with the backup and counted as newer than 0.1.0. Only an answer found for Wealthfolio Companion counts now; an old one is asked again at the next run. Nothing was ever installed from it - the updater asks GitHub itself.

## 0.1.0a2

- Proxmox install: the last step, showing the setup code, failed with exit code 208 (systemd-run got no stdin from the install engine) and offered to remove the finished container. It now runs with stdin from /dev/null, and a missing code never fails the install - the console then says to run `companion-cli setup-code` in the container.
- Move guide: paste the commands into the Proxmox console one at a time (it joins pasted lines).

## 0.1.0a1

Wealthfolio Broker Sync is now **Wealthfolio Companion**, starting over at 0.1.0 (alpha). It does what Broker Sync 0.48.1 did - the sync, countries and sectors, ISINs, logos, the spending tracker and X-Ray - under the new name; an existing installation is not migrated automatically (see *Moving from Wealthfolio Broker Sync* below).

- Repository `waldonso2/wealthfolio-companion`, container image `ghcr.io/waldonso2/wealthfolio-companion`, community-scripts slug `wealthfolio-companion` (`ct/wealthfolio-companion.sh`, `install/wealthfolio-companion-install.sh`).
- Names in the LXC: `/opt`, `/etc` and `/run/wealthfolio-companion`, units `wealthfolio-companion`, `-run`, `-cert`, `-update`, service user `companion`, systemd credential `companion-key`; commands `wealthfolio-companion` (in the venv and the image), `companion-cli`, `companion-reset-password`, `companion-autoupdate`.
- Environment variables `COMPANION_*` instead of `BROKERSYNC_*`; the image's secret is `companion-key`; metrics are `companion_*`.
- The UI, notifications and documents say Wealthfolio Companion; the header and *Über* show the version with its stage (Alpha).
- Versions follow PEP 440 pre-releases (0.1.0a1 < 0.1.0a2 < 0.1.0b1 < 0.1.0rc1 < 0.1.0) in the update check, the automatic update and `setup.sh`'s downgrade check; a pre-release says so in its GitHub release title but is never marked as one (releases/latest, which the update check and the install read, skips those).
- Unchanged, so existing data keeps working: the data files and their encryption, the `[SYNC <broker>:<id>]` references in Wealthfolio, the X-Ray addon's storage (`broker-sync-xray`), `/data`, `/tls` and UID 10001 in the image.
- `ct/wealthfolio-broker-sync.sh` installs nothing any more: an old container's `update` prints where this guide is and stops.

### Moving from Wealthfolio Broker Sync

An installation of Wealthfolio Broker Sync is not updated into Wealthfolio Companion: you install Wealthfolio Companion fresh and bring your data over with a backup and the old key. Nothing gets lost on the way: `restore` first checks that the backup opens with the key the new installation uses, and changes nothing otherwise - the old installation stays as it is until you remove it.

**Before you start:** if you set a master passphrase, remove it on the page *Sicherheit* of the old installation first (you set it again afterwards): a fresh installation can't unlock a backup sealed with it.

#### Proxmox VE (LXC)

1. In the console of the **old** container, write a backup and the key, and stop the daily fetch so nothing new is booked there:

   ```bash
   (umask 077; brokersync-cli backup > /root/move.tar.gz)
   (umask 077; if [ -f /etc/wealthfolio-broker-sync/key.cred ]; then systemd-creds decrypt --name=brokersync-key /etc/wealthfolio-broker-sync/key.cred - > /root/move.key; else cp /etc/wealthfolio-broker-sync/secret.key /root/move.key; fi)
   systemctl disable --now wealthfolio-broker-sync-run.timer wealthfolio-broker-sync-update.timer
   ```

2. Install Wealthfolio Companion as a new container: in the Proxmox host shell

   ```bash
   bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waldonso2/wealthfolio-companion/main/ct/wealthfolio-companion.sh)"
   ```

   You don't need the setup code it shows: the backup brings your password along.

3. In the Proxmox host shell, copy both files from the old container (`OLD`, its ID) to the new one (`NEW`):

   ```bash
   OLD=101 NEW=102   # your containers' IDs (pct list)
   (umask 077; pct pull $OLD /root/move.tar.gz /root/move.tar.gz && pct pull $OLD /root/move.key /root/move.key)
   pct push $NEW /root/move.tar.gz /root/move.tar.gz --perms 600 && pct push $NEW /root/move.key /root/move.key --perms 600
   shred -u /root/move.key /root/move.tar.gz
   ```

4. In the console of the **new** container, stop the service, put the old key in place of the new one (`setup.sh` seals a root-only `secret.key` with systemd-creds), empty the new installation's data (it holds nothing yet), run the setup again and restore the backup:

   ```bash
   systemctl stop wealthfolio-companion wealthfolio-companion-run.timer
   rm -f /etc/wealthfolio-companion/key.cred /etc/wealthfolio-companion/secret.key
   install -m 600 /root/move.key /etc/wealthfolio-companion/secret.key
   find /opt/wealthfolio-companion/data -mindepth 1 -delete
   bash /opt/wealthfolio-companion/app/deploy/setup.sh
   companion-cli restore < /root/move.tar.gz
   systemctl start wealthfolio-companion wealthfolio-companion-run.timer
   shred -u /root/move.key /root/move.tar.gz
   ```

   If `restore` says *Not restored, data/ unchanged*, the key doesn't fit the backup: check step 1 and run step 4 again.

5. Open the new container's web UI (`https://<its address>:8443`) and sign in with your old password. Its certificate comes from the new container's own CA: confirm the browser warning once, or import `/ca.crt` again. Set the master passphrase again if you had one, and switch the automatic update on again on the page *Updates* if you used it.

6. When everything is there, stop and remove the old container in Proxmox.

#### Docker / Podman

The old key and the old data volume stay as they are; only the image, the secret's name and the variables change.

1. Make a backup first (the old image's command is `brokersync`):

   ```bash
   (umask 077; docker compose exec -T brokersync brokersync backup > before-move.tar.gz)
   ```

2. Change `docker-compose.yml` - keep the service, volume and `hostname` names (a new hostname would replace the UI's CA):

   ```diff
    services:
      brokersync:
   -    image: ghcr.io/waldonso2/wealthfolio-broker-sync:latest
   +    image: ghcr.io/waldonso2/wealthfolio-companion:latest
        environment:
   -      BROKERSYNC_CERT_NAMES: "nas.fritz.box"
   +      COMPANION_CERT_NAMES: "nas.fritz.box"
        secrets:
   -      - brokersync-key
   +      - companion-key
    secrets:
   -  brokersync-key:
   +  companion-key:
        file: ./brokersync.key
   ```

   Every `BROKERSYNC_…` variable becomes `COMPANION_…` (`_TLS`, `_TRUST_PROXY`, `_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `_RUN_AT`, `_METRICS_TOKEN`, `_LOG_FORMAT` …). With `docker run`, change the image the same way and mount the key as `/run/secrets/companion-key`.

3. Start it:

   ```bash
   docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
   docker compose logs brokersync
   ```

   Commands in the container are now `wealthfolio-companion …` (`docker compose exec brokersync wealthfolio-companion security-status`). Should the data not open, the log says so and nothing was changed: `before-move.tar.gz` restores the old state with the old image.

## Wealthfolio Broker Sync (up to 0.48.1)

## 0.48.1

- The update check follows a redirect within github.com to the first release tag, so it keeps finding new versions once the repository is renamed (Wealthfolio Companion); never another host, https only.

## 0.48.0

- *Einstellungen* look and work like Wealthfolio's: the pages in groups (Allgemein, Verbindung, Sicherheit, Daten, Über) with uppercase titles; on phones `/settings` is a list of rows with icon, title, one line and a chevron, and each page links back to it; from 1024px a sidebar beside the page. It replaces the sub-bar of the settings pages.
- *Darstellung* like Wealthfolio's: the font as tiles "Aa" (Wie Wealthfolio - the default, the font read from Wealthfolio -, Sans, Serif, Mono), the theme as tiles with a small preview (Hell, Dunkel, System), then the language; stored as `Config.ui_font` / `ui_scheme`, an unknown value comes back with 422. The header's symbol still turns the colours round until logout, also a fixed theme.
- New page *Über* (`/about`, also linked in the footer): Wealthfolio Companion, its version, what it does, links to the docs and GitHub, where to report a bug or a vulnerability, licence, credits and which hosts the service sends data to.

## 0.47.0

- Every service on *Dienste* has its own page `/services/<key>` (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#151), all built the same way: name, switch and what it writes into Wealthfolio (with what is still missing and a link), its status, its settings, and *Jetzt ausführen* as a background job - the same step a run calls, under the sync lock. *Aus Wealthfolio entfernen* (countries & sectors, X-Ray in Wealthfolio) asks for a confirmation, switches the service off and removes only what it wrote. The gears on *Dienste* always lead there, and switching on a service that lacks something opens its page.
- Broker-Sync: a traffic light and the last fetch per broker, the fetch mode with a link to *Sicherheit*, *Broker einrichten*.
- Countries & sectors: the last write, names without a category, and per fund where its countries and sectors come from; the switch and *Aus Wealthfolio entfernen* moved here from the X-Ray settings, which link to it.
- ISIN ergänzen: which securities got an ISIN and when (stored with the moment from now on), which still have none, *Jetzt ergänzen*, and a link to the manual mapping.
- Logos: `/logos` became `/services/logos` (the old address redirects); the service's switch replaces the page's own checkbox; a malformed key comes back with 422 at its field.
- Spending tracker: one checkbox list of every broker's cash account, saved at once; the field *Ausgaben auswerten* left the broker form, which links here.
- X-Ray in Wealthfolio: last write, stale keys, funds with a list and those missing one with the reason, "Wealthfolio zu alt" before 3.11, *Jetzt ablegen*, and how to install the addon.
- *Logos* is no longer listed under *Einstellungen* (it is a service now).

## 0.46.2

- The UI uses the font chosen in Wealthfolio (Settings → Appearance), read from its API when the connection is saved and once per run: JetBrains Mono (Wealthfolio's default), Inter or Merriweather, the same files Wealthfolio bundles.
- Without a font read from Wealthfolio, its default (theme Classic, "font-mono"): JetBrains Mono as the static weights 400-700 Wealthfolio bundles instead of a variable font. Text at 0.875rem/1.25rem without tabular figures, the page title like its page header, section labels in cards (h3) and the labels of phone tables in uppercase with its letter-spacing, table heads in the text size.
- The switch on *Dienste* has Wealthfolio's size (2.75 x 1.5rem); its touch target stays 44px high.

## 0.46.1

- Looks like Wealthfolio's Classic theme: JetBrains Mono instead of Inter and Merriweather, semibold headings in the same font, sizes in rem on Wealthfolio's type scale (the browser's text size scales the whole UI), its card colour and shadow, pill buttons and fields 2.75rem high, switches in its primary colour, the overlap heatmap in its sage ramp.
- The icon uses Wealthfolio's brown instead of blue.

## 0.46.0

- Runs as a Docker container too (#148): `ghcr.io/waldonso2/wealthfolio-broker-sync` for amd64 and arm64, signed with cosign and with build provenance; `deploy/docker-compose.example.yml` starts it next to Wealthfolio. The key comes as a container secret - without it nothing starts, and no key is ever made in the data volume. Migration, the first setup code (in the log), the UI certificate and the daily fetch happen in the container itself; it runs without root and with a read-only file system. Updates are a new image (`docker compose pull`); the page *Updates* says so.
- The README is shorter, with a diagram of how the service, Wealthfolio and the X-Ray addon work together; the details per bank, the functions and the operation are in `docs/`.

## 0.45.0

- New service *X-Ray in Wealthfolio* on the page *Dienste* (off, also for existing installations): after each X-Ray pass the funds' holdings lists go into Wealthfolio's addon storage for the new X-Ray addon, which shows X-Ray inside Wealthfolio. Only the issuers' lists and the assets' names and ISINs are written, never amounts. Needs Wealthfolio 3.11 or later; with an older one the card says so.
- The data contract between the service and the addon is `contract/xray/` (storage layout and shared computation cases).

## 0.44.2

More fixes from the code review in #134:

- A transaction whose activities were all already in Wealthfolio (an interrupted run) keeps their ids in the sync state instead of an empty list.
- One activity without a readable date no longer stops the comparison with Wealthfolio; it is skipped and logged.
- An empty answer from Finanzfluss (a changed page) no longer wipes the countries and sectors it gave before; it is logged.
- A stale or planted unlock cache opens nothing: the data key is checked against the passphrase's check value.
- Two login requests for the same broker at the same moment: the second is refused instead of sending a TAN twice.
- N26 and Enable Banking stop at once when a page or continuation key comes again (N26 at most 200 pages).
- The holdings check keeps its notified deviations when the UI writes at the same time.
- `wealthfolio.Duplicate` is now `DuplicateActivity` (internal).

## 0.44.1

Fixes from the code review in #134:

- A booking equal to one the sync booked shortly before (two equal card payments or deposits within 36 hours) is booked; it was taken for the earlier one and never booked. The sync's own activities are never a match for another transaction.
- Saving a broker's new credentials starts the login in the background thread pool: the whole UI no longer stands still while the bank answers.
- The back link of an error page only leads to a path of this site (a Referer like `//host` was taken).
- A login link from the bank is shown only as `https://`.
- Wealthfolio's activity list is read to the end even when an answer carries no total.
- N26 and Enable Banking stop after 1000 pages instead of fetching for ever.
- After saving the notifications the page *Broker* opens, like after every other save.
- *Sicherheit* no longer claims that `sc` without Landlock can't read the key: without the sandbox it runs as the service user.

## 0.44.0

- New start page *Dienste* (#145): every service that writes into Wealthfolio - broker sync, countries & sectors, ISINs, logos, spending tracker - with an iOS-like switch and a gear to its settings. A new install starts with everything off; switching a service on that still lacks something opens its settings and turns it on once they are saved. Existing installs keep what runs today.
- The overview, *Prüfung* and *Unbekannt* are one page *Broker* (`/broker`, sub-bar Status · Prüfung · Unbekannt); the header holds Dienste, Broker, X-Ray, Einstellungen. Notification links lead to `/broker`.
- The app has an icon in the browser tab.

## 0.43.0

- Countries and sectors into Wealthfolio, last resort: Finanzfluss' breakdown of the whole fund (countries by ISO code; its industries mapped to the GICS sectors). Taken for a fund only where its issuer's list covers less than half (L&G, uploaded lists without countries or sectors, …); the fund's card then says the values come from Finanzfluss. Finanzfluss is now read for every fund every 30 days (with the TER, which an issuer's still takes precedence over).

## 0.42.2

- Sectors into Wealthfolio: the GICS 2023 names the issuers use ("Airlines", "Automobile Components", "Ground Transportation", "Marine Transportation", "Personal Care Products") find Wealthfolio's categories, which still carry the earlier names.

## 0.42.1

- Countries and sectors into Wealthfolio, checked against live lists: SPDR's GICS names without commas ("Oil Gas & Consumable Fuels"), DWS' (Xtrackers) German sector names ("Technologie", "Industrieunternehmen", "Finanzdienstleister" …) and country spellings ("Großbritannien (UK)", "Süd Korea", VanEck's "Taiwan Region") now find their category.
- A single-country iShares fund (MSCI India, S&P 500 sector funds) gets its country from iShares' fund finder; the finder is read once a pass also for funds of the shipped list, so their TER comes from iShares too.

## 0.42.0

- X-Ray: *Jetzt abrufen* shows a progress bar (which ETF of how many) while the lists are fetched.
- Countries into Wealthfolio for iShares funds, whose holdings name no country: a broad fund's own breakdown (iShares' sheet "Exposure Breakdowns") is written; otherwise a line takes the country another of the user's funds names for the same company (e.g. SPDR's S&P 500 list for an S&P 500 sector fund). What stays open (cash, "Other") is unassigned.
- Sectors: a GICS industry or industry group ("Banks", "Aerospace & Defense") counts for its sector instead of staying unassigned.
- Performance report: X-Ray with 15 funds of up to 3000 lines (response time, page size), KPIs in KENNZAHLEN.md.

## 0.41.0

- X-Ray is fast again with large ETFs: the page renders only the rows it shows - the overall matrix its top 10 (25, 50, 100 or all on request), each ETF its 10 largest positions, all of them only when asked (`?fund=`). With 15 funds of up to 3000 lines the page went from 6.7 MB to 0.1 MB. A fund's weights are computed once per page, not once per pair of funds.
- The ETF cards sit in one folded card "ETFs", each ETF folded again.
- Countries and sectors into Wealthfolio: countries are found by ISO code (`country_US`) - also as German names ("Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika", "Deutschland") and bare codes ("US") - and sectors also under German names ("Informationstechnologie"), so far fewer lines stay unassigned.

## 0.40.0

- X-Ray reads the TER of every ETF whose issuer lists none (Xtrackers, Invesco, Vanguard, VanEck, UBS, uploaded lists, …) from its page at Finanzfluss, by ISIN; asked again after 30 days, also when Finanzfluss had none. An issuer's TER and one typed by hand still come first.

## 0.39.0

- X-Ray: every card (overall matrix, overlap, each ETF) is folded; an ETF opened shows its 10 largest positions first, all of them folded below, and a link to its page at Finanzfluss. The overall matrix starts at the top 10 (10, 25, 50 or 100).
- The TER comes with the holdings where the issuer lists it: iShares (screener field `ter`/`ter_ocf`), SPDR (fund finder), Amundi (product API), ARK (fund page), HANetf (product list). It shows in the ETF's card and feeds the costs; a TER typed by hand still comes first.
- The upload accepts `.xls` files (UBS' download is an XLSX named `.xls`); an old binary Excel file gets a message to save it as XLSX or CSV.

## 0.38.1

- An uploaded UBS holdings list (the "Constituents" download of the ETF's page) is read: its name column "Wertpapiere" is recognised.

## 0.38.0

- X-Ray fetches HANetf ETFs (Future of Defence, EMQQ, …) automatically: the holdings XLSX lies under the fund's code and ISIN on hanetf.com; the codes of 75 HANetf funds ship in `fund_products.json`. A fund whose ISIN is in that list is recognised as HANetf's even when its name doesn't say so. The file's "Exposure Country" and "Trading Currency" columns are read.

## 0.37.1

- X-Ray reads L&G ETFs from the address of their daily holdings CSV ("Fundholdings.csv" on fundcentres.lgim.com), saved once under the ETF's settings; after that the list is fetched every day. The CSV's columns ("Security Description", "Constituent Weight (Base)") are read.

## 0.37.0

- X-Ray fetches ARK Europe's ETFs (also the Rize ones) by ISIN: the fund page names it, the full holdings are the XLSX below it; the ids ship in `fund_products.json` and are renewed weekly.
- HANetf funds (Future of Defence, EMQQ) are recognised by name.
- Issuers that block automatic fetching (WisdomTree, UBS, HANetf) or offer no open full list (L&G, …): their ETF's settings offer the upload of the holdings list downloaded from the ETF's page (CSV or Excel); it counts until the next upload.

## 0.36.0

- X-Ray looks through the ETFs of other issuers too, fetched by ISIN without any setting: Xtrackers (DWS XLSX), SPDR (fund finder ISIN → ticker, daily holdings XLSX), Amundi/Lyxor (product API), Invesco (index list first, so a swap ETF shows its index stocks), Vanguard (product API by portfolio id) and VanEck (holdings block). Vanguard's and VanEck's ids ship in `fund_products.json`, renewed weekly with the iShares list; an id not shipped yet is looked up once a pass.
- Every ETF is shown with a card like the iShares ones; the issuer comes from its name. One without a list (an issuer without automatic fetching yet, such as L&G or WisdomTree) gets the reason at its card.
- The overall matrix holds stocks only: an ETF still without its list is named above it instead of being a row.
- An Amundi swap ETF is marked: its list is the fund's basket, not the index.
- Names with a par value (Invesco: "APPLE INC USD0.00001") meet the same company from other issuers.

## 0.35.3

- The shipped iShares product list knows 129 more funds, among them the German-domiciled (DE) ones from the German site's fund finder.

## 0.35.2

- X-Ray finds German-domiciled iShares ETFs (DE): the German site's new fund finder (its screener server) is asked first; it is the only one listing them.
- X-Ray on phones: every row is a grid with fixed columns for the figures, so rows no longer shift; the sector column is gone, the country shows only on wide screens.
- The overlap of the ETFs is a real ETF × ETF matrix with a heatmap, right below the overall matrix.
- The weekly iShares product run starts CI before it opens its pull request, and opens an issue linking its branch if GitHub Actions may not open pull requests.

## 0.35.1

- **The shipped iShares product list is filled:** 1,238 iShares funds with their product numbers, read by the weekly workflow from the Dutch, Italian and Spanish fund finders. X-Ray now finds the holdings of every listed iShares ETF without asking a fund finder.

## 0.35.0

- **iShares product numbers ship with the service:**
  - `src/brokersync/ishares_products.json` maps ISIN → product number for every fund the country fund finders list. X-Ray looks there first, so a container no longer reads the finders' megabytes for a fund in it. A product page typed in and a number kept before still win; a fund missing from the file is still looked up live.
  - `scripts/ishares_products.py` builds it, from the finders or from answers saved with curl. It keeps every number already there (a number never changes) and fails when no answer named a product.
  - The weekly workflow `ishares-products.yml` runs it. When funds were added, it opens a pull request and starts CI for it (`ci.yml` can now be started by hand). New numbers come with the next release.

## 0.34.5

- **X-Ray finds the iShares product number by ISIN again.**
  - The fund finders of the Dutch, Italian and Spanish sites still answer, with every product they sell keyed by its number. The German and UK ones answer 404 since iShares rebuilt them.
  - The sites are asked in turn (NL, IT, ES, UK). Each is read at most once a pass, and only while an ISIN is still unknown.
  - A product's number is the same on every site; it is taken from the product page link or, without one, from the list's key.
  - A product page typed in still wins.

## 0.34.4

- **X-Ray compact on phones:** a fund's holdings and the overall matrix show one line per stock (name, sector, weight, EUR) instead of a block per field. The matrix's columns per ETF appear on wider screens only. The column *Land* is left out when the list names no country (iShares' current download names none).
- **The header's hint while iShares names no product number** says what to do: enter the product page once.
- **An iShares ETF without a list** has its settings open, with a link *Bei iShares suchen*. It opens iShares' product list filtered by the ISIN; open the hit and paste its address (iShares no longer names a product for an ISIN to anyone but its own pages).

## 0.34.3

- **X-Ray reads the holdings from iShares' new download:**
  - iShares rebuilt its site (10/2026): the fund finder answers 404, and the old CSV address answers with the product page.
  - The holdings now come from the product page's own download ("Daten herunterladen"), an Excel 2003 XML workbook fetched from `www.blackrock.com` by product number. Its sheet "Holdings" is read: German columns (Emittententicker, Name, Sektor, Gewichtung (%), Marktwährung) with decimal commas. This file names no location or exchange, so countries stay empty. A bare `&` in a name is tolerated.
  - A fund whose product number is known works again: a product page typed in under "Einstellungen dieses ETFs" (the address may end at the number), or a number found or kept before.
  - Finding the number from the ISIN alone follows.

## 0.34.2

- **The automatic update works:** the updater's unit sets `TERM=xterm`. Without it, the install engine's `clear` failed ("TERM environment variable not set") and every automatic update stopped before it started. A container on 0.34.0/0.34.1 still has the old unit: update it once by hand (`update`).
- **The program stays readable for the service after an automatic update:** the updater ran with `UMask=0077`, so the new program files were root-only. The service (user `brokersync`) couldn't start (`203/EXEC`), and migrating the data failed. The unit now uses 0022, like the console, and `setup.sh` sets `umask 022` itself. Repair after such an update: `chmod -R u=rwX,go=rX /opt/wealthfolio-broker-sync/venv /opt/wealthfolio-broker-sync/app /opt/wealthfolio-broker-sync/bin`, then `brokersync-cli migrate` and `systemctl restart wealthfolio-broker-sync`.

## 0.34.1

- **X-Ray: product addresses without the page's name are accepted (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#144).**
  - iShares links often end at the product number (`…/produkte/308858/`). Both the site search's hits and a product page typed in were refused because the pattern required a name after the number.
  - The number alone now suffices, as in the reference implementation; the export finds the list by the number.
- **The German site's search is asked too** when the UK site's search doesn't know the ISIN.
- **No more HTTP 429 from iShares:**
  - The site's search is asked only for iShares ETFs (by name, source or saved page), never for single stocks.
  - Requests to iShares are spaced by 1.5 s.
  - After a 429, nothing more is asked in that pass; the next run tries again.
  - A product found once is kept with the fund (`product` in its status), so each ETF is searched only once.

## 0.34.0

- **Automatic updates (opt-in, page *Updates* under *Einstellungen*):**
  - When switched on, the container looks for a newer release as often as set there: every 60 seconds by default, at most once a day. It installs a new release with the same unattended `update` as the console (`PHS_SILENT=1`): every file checked against `SHA256SUMS`, the data backed up first.
  - Afterwards ntfy says which version runs now. The page shows the last result.
  - A failed version is retried after an hour, and nothing is updated while a fetch runs.
  - New: `wealthfolio-broker-sync-update.timer`/`.service` (root, every minute; installs nothing while switched off), `deploy/brokersync-autoupdate`, and `brokersync update-due` / `update-done`.
  - The switch and the interval live in the host tier, so updates also run while the master passphrase locks the data. Switching needs the UI password.
- The daily "new version" message is not sent while automatic updates are on; the updater reports the installed version itself.

## 0.33.2

- **X-Ray finds iShares ETFs without the fund finder (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#144):** iShares' fund finder answers 404 since 10/2026. While it fails, each ISIN is looked up in the iShares site's search (`autoComplete.search`); only an unambiguous product is taken, never a guess. The header shows the fund finder's failure as a note, no longer as an error.
- A single stock the search couldn't check is no longer counted as a failed fetch (it isn't shown).

## 0.33.1

- **X-Ray shows why a list is missing (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#144):**
  - Each iShares ETF has its own card, also without a list, with the reason a fetch failed: iShares not reachable (HTTP status), the fund finder's answer not JSON or without products, its ISIN unknown to the fund finder, or no ISIN in Wealthfolio.
  - The header shows the last fetch (lists fetched, failed) and an error that stopped the whole pass (`meta` `funds:last`).
  - A fund finder answer that parses but holds no products was taken as "no source" for every ETF; it is now an error, retried the next day, and its layout (names only) is logged.
  - Fund finder values given as `{d, r}` are read too.
- **Every position is fetched**, not only the 30 largest; the time budget still limits a pass.
- **ISINs the sync learned** are used for positions Wealthfolio keeps without one.
- **Only iShares ETFs are shown** for now; single stocks and other issuers' ETFs are hidden and still count as one position each.
- **Layout as agreed:** one *Jetzt abrufen* at the top, Top 25/50/100 for the overall matrix, "nicht zugeordnet" below it, the FIRE calculator and the explanations at the bottom, *Neu lesen* under the settings.

## 0.33.0

- **X-Ray (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#144):** the look-through is redone as the page *X-Ray*.
  - **Fetching:** iShares holdings lists are fetched automatically every morning, with no switch. *Jetzt abrufen* per ETF fetches one list, *Alle Positionslisten jetzt abrufen* fetches all.
  - **Overall matrix at the top:** every stock with its EUR through each of the 4 largest ETFs, the other ETFs together, held directly, total and share of the depot. The top 25 are shown, the rest is folded.
  - **One card per ETF:** its top 25 holdings with weight in the ETF and the EUR in your depot; all holdings folded.
  - Cluster risks, costs, overlap and settings are folded at the bottom.
  - For now only iShares: Xtrackers is no longer asked (DWS no longer learns the depot's ISINs), and the upload is hidden.
  - Cluster risks are notified only once at least one ETF has a list, so an ETF without one doesn't raise a false single-stock alarm.

## 0.32.0

- **Banks over PSD2, e.g. N26 (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#137):** *Bank über PSD2 1–3* read a giro account through Enable Banking, a licensed account information service, with the user's own app in its free restricted mode (only the user's own accounts). App id and private key are kept in the vault; every request is signed with the key. The login opens the bank's page; afterwards the user pastes the address the bank sent them to. The consent lasts as long as the bank allows; ntfy reminds 7 days and 1 day before it ends, and a scheduled run never starts a login by itself. Bookings as for FinTS banks; pending ones wait until they are booked. No depot over PSD2. The README says that the account data passes through Enable Banking.
- **N26 (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#135):** the main account over the interface of the N26 app (unofficial; the broker settings ask for agreement first, as for Trade Republic). Login with e-mail and password, confirmed in the N26 app; afterwards the token is refreshed without the user, and a scheduled run never pushes a new login into the app. A rejected password stops every further attempt until the credentials are saved anew. Booked transactions only (pending ones wait), ids `n26-<id>`; the balance is compared after each run. Money moved to a Space is a withdrawal unless a transfer pattern books it as a transfer.
- **Missing ISINs completed in Wealthfolio (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#140):** after every run, every asset the sync knows by ISIN whose ISIN is empty in Wealthfolio gets it (`metadata.identifiers.isin`), so Wealthfolio matches imports, quotes and bonds by it and the logos find it. Everything else of the asset - name, notes, profile, symbol, exchange - is sent back unchanged; an ISIN already there is never replaced, and one the sync set and the user removed stays removed.
- **Install engine moved to community-scripts/core `8354b06`** (#97), after reviewing its 51 commits. Nothing new is sent and no engine function the install uses changed. What changes for an install:
  - Closing the console no longer aborts it.
  - `update` cleans up (apt autoremove/clean) after a successful run.
  - A failed update is deployed again by the next `update` instead of reporting "no update".
  - When Proxmox' template catalog can't be reached, the engine takes Debian from images.linuxcontainers.org.
- The closing message of the install puts an IPv6 address in brackets, so the link to the setup page works.

## 0.31.0

- **Durchschau: holdings lists every day, one button per position.**
  - The ETFs' holdings lists are fetched again every day with the morning run instead of weekly, in the safe fetch mode too (then without contacting any broker).
  - Each position has its own *Jetzt abrufen*, which fetches just its list in the background.
  - Under each fund with a list, its 50 largest holdings are shown with weight, country and sector; *Alle n anzeigen* shows the full list.

## 0.30.0

- **Durchschau (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#139):** a new page in the main menu shows what the depot really holds across all Wealthfolio accounts: every stock once with its share, value, country and sector and through which positions (a stock in three ETFs and held directly is one row) - top 50, top 100 or all; what the funds' holdings lists leave open as "nicht zugeordnet", never scaled up; the overlap of every two ETFs, each ETF's own contribution and the effective number of stocks. A position without a holdings list is one line of its own. New table `funds` (state.db migration 4).
- **Holdings lists fetched or uploaded:** opt-in, after every fetch and at most weekly per ETF, the service gets the lists from Xtrackers (by ISIN) and iShares (by ISIN through iShares' own fund finder, or from a product page saved once); only the ISIN or that page leaves the container, only these two hosts over https, answers capped at 20 MB, a list must look complete before it replaces the stored one. Any other issuer's list can be uploaded as CSV or XLSX.
- **Cluster risks:** a single stock, a country, a sector, foreign currency, two strongly overlapping ETFs, too few effective stocks, and cash above the deposit guarantee on one account - limits on the page, each risk can be marked as intended, new ones are notified once via ntfy.
- **Countries and sectors into Wealthfolio** (opt-in): each fund's weighted countries and GICS sectors go into Wealthfolio's taxonomies, so its own allocation views see through the funds instead of Yahoo's single country. Only Yahoo's automatic values are replaced, never the user's own; *Aus Wealthfolio entfernen* takes them out again.
- **FIRE-Rechner:** how much wealth a life on the depot needs, in today's money, with the German flat tax, solidarity surcharge and church tax on the gain share only, the 30 % partial exemption, the saver's allowance, voluntary statutory health and care insurance (or a private premium) and the statutory pension from its start: lean, regular, fat and Barista FIRE, years to the goal, Coast FIRE. Wealth and gain share come from Wealthfolio unless typed. Values of 2026.
- **Kosten (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#142):** per position and for the depot, what is incurred from buy to sale - order fees and taxes from the Wealthfolio activities, the spread, ongoing charges (TER × mean of cost basis and value × years held) and the custody fee, plus the estimated cost of selling today; weighted TER, total cost ratio a year and costs a year in EUR. Taxes are shown apart and are not in the ratio. The TER of iShares funds comes from the fund finder, any other one is typed per position (it goes first); without a TER a position has no cost ratio, never 0 %. Each broker gets a fee model (fee per sale fixed and/or in percent, spread, custody fee); without one the sale is "not estimated". A new cluster risk "Gesamtkostenquote" over 0.5 % a year, and the FIRE calculator takes the cost ratio off the return (prefilled, can be overridden) and shows the result without costs next to it.
- `scripts/lookthrough_probe.py` checks from the container which issuer sources answer.
- Review fixes before release: a fund whose weights add up to more than 100 % (a negative cash line) is scaled down instead of refused by Wealthfolio, and one refused fund no longer keeps the others out; our countries/sectors go when a new list no longer names them, and *Aus Wealthfolio entfernen* also finds funds sold since; an XLSX cell beyond Excel's last column is ignored and uploads are read off the event loop (a crafted file could hang the UI); a pass fetches at most 5 minutes; an empty answer from Wealthfolio no longer resets which risks were notified; a new buy's order fee counts over at least a year (it set off a cost alarm for months); FIRE charges the GKV minimum only in bridge years without other income and nothing after the pension with the new switch *In der Rente pflichtversichert (KVdR)*; upload errors are translated; the README says DWS learns every position's ISIN.

## 0.29.1

- Dependency updates: fastapi 0.143.3 and starlette 1.8.0 (runtime); ruff 0.17.1 and filelock 4.2.1 (CI tools - filelock fixes six advisories, CVE-2026-112906 and others); `actions/checkout` v7.0.1 and `actions/setup-python` v7.0.0 in the workflows. enum-tools stays at 0.12.0: python-fints requires a version below 0.13.

## 0.29.0

- **Spending per bank (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#134):** a new switch *Ausgaben auswerten* in a broker's settings puts its cash account into Wealthfolio's spending tracker after the next fetch (and turns the tracker on). Wealthfolio categorizes the bookings with its own rules (*Spending → Rules*, with presets), which match the activity's note - the comment already names counterparty and purpose, so no activity changes and nothing is booked anew. Own transfers and securities settlements are linked pairs, which the tracker counts as saving or neutral, not as spending. Switched off, the account leaves the tracker again, unless it was tracked in Wealthfolio before; accounts chosen there are never removed. A Wealthfolio without the tracker only logs a warning.

## 0.28.1

- Security updates of two locked dependencies (CI job `audit`): certifi 2026.10.19 (PYSEC-2026-4320) and setuptools 84.1.0 (GHSA-xmj3-9gf7-h52w).

## 0.28.0

- **Complete unknown bookings (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#132):** on *Unbekannte Buchungen*, each booking can be completed: buy or sale (shares and the money that moved, fee, tax), delivery in without payment (shares and cost basis), delivery out without payment, or a split. The next fetch books it by the booking model under the booking's own id, so it leaves the list and is never booked twice, even once the service learns the type itself. Until then it can be withdrawn. New table `completions` (state.db migration 3).
- **Splits and reverse splits (#133):** booked as one SPLIT activity on the securities account with Wealthfolio's ratio (new shares per old one; a 1:10 reverse split is 0.1). Trade Republic's reverse splits (waldonso2/Wealthfolio-broker-sync-service#81, #82) and dividend reinvestments (#77) can be completed this way.

## 0.27.0

- **Any bank with FinTS (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#136):** *Weitere Bank 1–3 (FinTS)* connect a bank without a profile of its own - Sparkasse, Volks- und Raiffeisenbank and most other German banks - with its bank code and FinTS address (https only) as credentials. Bookings as for DKB with the standard posting patterns; a reported depot's holdings are read but count as incomplete. Up to three such banks at once; each keeps its key for good.
- **The bank code is enough:** for *Weitere Bank*, the FinTS address comes from the Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft's list of FinTS banks (1,716 bank codes), shipped with the service and kept out of plain sight like the product id. The field is only needed for a bank the list lacks.
- **The service's own FinTS product id is built in:** the field *FinTS-Produkt-ID* is gone for every FinTS bank. An id entered before is used until the bank's credentials are saved anew; then the bank may ask once more for a confirmation in its app. The id is kept out of plain sight in the code and out of logs and pages.
- The broker form now checks bank code (8 digits), FinTS address and IBANs on the server; a wrong one comes back at its field.
- **Hint at a new version:** after a fetch, at most once a day, the service asks GitHub which release is the newest (only the redirect of `releases/latest` is read; nothing is sent). A newer one is shown on the overview with a link to its notes, and ntfy tells it once. Installing stays `update` in the container's console. `BROKERSYNC_UPDATE_CHECK=0` turns the check off.

## 0.26.1

- **Faster duplicate check:** matching against the activities already in Wealthfolio parses each one once and looks only at the same account, type and time window (36 h, settlements 6 days), instead of re-reading every activity for every booking. The rules and their order are unchanged (`contract/dedup/cases.json`). In the performance report, a run of 300 bookings against 3000 existing activities took 2.0 s instead of 3.7 s.
- **Contrast in dark mode:** links had 4.4:1 on cards (WCAG AA asks 4.5:1); the dark accent is now `#66a0c8` (6.1:1).
- CI: zizmor for the workflows, ruff with `S`/`SIM`/`PERF`/`C4`/`RUF`, every page checked in Chromium (axe-core, CSP, phone width), a performance report on the run's summary page that never fails a build, OpenSSF Scorecard, Dependabot cooldown of 7 days. `KENNZAHLEN.md` lists the KPIs with their reference standards.

## 0.26.0

- **JSON logs and metrics (OPS-04 of #85):** `BROKERSYNC_LOG_FORMAT=json` writes one JSON object per log line, redacted like the plain lines. `GET /metrics` gives Prometheus text: fetches per broker and outcome, and the last fetch's time, duration, success and failed bookings - no amounts, no names. It needs the UI login, or for a scraper `Authorization: Bearer <BROKERSYNC_METRICS_TOKEN>` (at least 32 characters).
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` for `ct/`, `install/`, `deploy/` and `.github/` (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#88; takes effect with branch protection).

## 0.25.0

Audit 2.0 (waldonso2/Wealthfolio-broker-sync-service#85), every finding checked against the code:

- **Encrypted database on ARM64 (SEC-05):** SQLCipher now also comes for ARM64 (`sqlcipher3-wheels`, a build of the same `sqlcipher3` module; locked with hashes). An existing plain `state.db` is encrypted at the next start. Only platforms without either wheel (e.g. 32-bit ARM) stay plain, as *Sicherheit* says.
- **Setup code never in a URL (V-01):** a password that is too short or too common no longer sends the browser to `/setup-password?code=…` (the history kept the code); the page comes back with the code in its form.
- **Masked texts in the comparison (SEC-04):** what *Prüfung* stores about missing bookings and deviations has its texts masked like unknown bookings (IBANs, long numbers); ids, amounts and ISINs stay.
- **No error page for a damaged setup code (V-02):** it counts as expired.
- **Run texts in English (V-04):** "aborted by a restart" follows the page's language; texts of banks and brokers stay as they are.
- **TAN pictures only embedded (SEC-08):** the login shows a TAN graphic only as a data: URL (the CSP already allowed nothing else).
- **Duplicates by meaning (SEC-09):** Wealthfolio's duplicate answer is recognised in any wording.
- **Bank not answering (UX-04):** FinTS says in German that the bank doesn't answer (network or timeout), the technical text after it.
- **Login: until when, and start over (UX-05):** the login page says until when it waits and offers *Anmeldung neu starten*.
- Checked and already in place: the FinTS session never holds the PIN (SEC-02 - python-fints doesn't serialise it; a test now pins the blob's contents), `BROKERSYNC_TRUST_PROXY` (SEC-03, since 0.20.0), progress of a run and screen-reader labels (UX-01, A11Y-01, since 0.21.0), the Argon2 parameters of the passphrase (V-03: stored with it since 0.9.0).
- Planned for 0.26.0: optional JSON logs and metrics (OPS-04).

## 0.24.1

- **Light/dark stays when you change the page (#123):** the header's symbol switched only the page it was tapped on; the next page came back in the device's colours. The session now remembers the choice: every page until you log out, a new session starts in the device's colours again. Still no JavaScript (a small form like *Abmelden*).
- The symbol sits at the height of the logout symbol.

## 0.24.0

- **Light or dark from the header (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#123):** a symbol in the header (a half-filled circle, also on phones) switches between light and dark with one tap. Every visit starts in the device's colours; the switch lasts until the page is reloaded. It works without JavaScript (a checkbox evaluated by CSS), so the CSP stays as it was.
- The colour scheme is no longer chosen on *Darstellung* (only the language); a fixed choice saved before is ignored.

## 0.23.2

- **"Fehlt in Wealthfolio" for bookings that are there:** a transaction booked before whose activities the sync can't find any more is first looked for among the imports, with the rules of the duplicate detection. If an import holds the same booking, it is linked to that activity and not reported. This happens when Wealthfolio took every part of a booking for a duplicate of the import (nothing created, so no id to remember), or when an import was booked anew. Bookings that are really gone are reported as before.

## 0.23.1

- **Trade Republic: three more kinds of bookings** (waldonso2/Wealthfolio-broker-sync-service#76, #78, #79, as the CSV import books them):
  - a tax correction that takes money (pytr calls it a refund) is a tax (TAX);
  - a referral bonus is a bonus (CREDIT/BONUS) on the cash account;
  - a security written off as worthless is a sale at 0 on the securities account, without any transfer.
- A dividend reinvestment stays unknown (#77): pytr reads no share count for it. Book it by hand or import it.
- An unknown booking that a later run books (after *Ab Startdatum neu abrufen*) leaves the page *Unbekannt*.
- README: only the current version is described.

## 0.23.0

Data and cleanup, with the addon's 3.9.4 (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#121).

- **Duplicate detection (#100):** of several activities that fit, the nearest in time is the one (then the closest amount) - two equal savings-plan deposits on two days each find their own, not the first in Wealthfolio's list. Two currencies never match. New shared cases in `contract/dedup/cases.json`, the addon applies the same rules.
- **`Position.value` removed (#118):** read nowhere, and 100 times too high for bonds priced in per cent; MT535 reads only shares and currency.
- **Simpler code (#80):** no C901 exception left; `mapping.to_activities`, `reconcile.compare`, `audit.check`, `assets.learn_from_imports`, `coverage.check`, the FinTS account lookup, `scalable._netted`, `mt535._holding` and `mt536.parse` split into named steps (activities, comments and ids unchanged); imports before the bank history and opening positions in `history.py`; the version only in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Unofficial interface and FinTS product id (#112):** Trade Republic asks once in the broker settings that its note was read - without it no login starts; brokers set up before count as agreed. The FinTS product id field says to use only your own registered id.

## 0.22.0

Transport, isolation, operation (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#121).

- **The UI's CA signs only this container (#92):** its name constraints are now exactly the container's name, `localhost` and its current addresses (each a single address), no longer every private network and local domain - whoever has its key can't vouch for the router or the NAS. **Import the CA once more after this update** (page *Sicherheit*); a new address means a new CA. CA valid 2 years. A root timer (`wealthfolio-broker-sync-cert.timer`, `brokersync renew-cert`) renews the certificate daily and restarts the UI when it changed. More names or addresses (also Tailscale's 100.64.0.0/10) in `/etc/wealthfolio-broker-sync/tls/extra-names`.
- **`sc` in a sandbox (#93):** Scalable's CLI runs under Landlock (`brokersync.sandbox`): it can't read `data/`, the key or the unlock cache, and writes only its temp dir; its environment holds no `CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY` or `BROKERSYNC_*`. The units allow `@sandbox`. A kernel without Landlock runs it without, and *Sicherheit* says so.
- **Honest protection (#94):** *Sicherheit* tells TPM, the container's host secret and a root-only file apart; without a TPM and a master passphrase it says a container backup holds key and data. Footer and summary claim database encryption only with SQLCipher. `setup.sh` moves a root-only key into `systemd-creds` once that can encrypt.
- **Wealthfolio with its own certificate (#95):** trusted by its SHA-256 fingerprint, checked in the TLS handshake before the password is sent. The page shows the fingerprint of a certificate nobody vouches for, to compare and save. *Nur testen* checks address, certificate and password without saving; a warning at the field for `http://`.
- **Event log (#102):** logins (also failed), logouts, password, sessions, credentials, Wealthfolio address, passphrase, fetch mode, *Neu aufsetzen*, lock and unlock, with the client's address, on *Sicherheit* (last 100, kept 180 days; new table, migration 2). A login from a new address is notified via ntfy.
- **Backup and restore (#109):** `brokersync-cli backup > file`, `brokersync-cli restore < file` - restore checks the archive opens with this container's key before it touches `data/`, keeps the previous data, refuses while the UI runs.
- The command line is one function per command.

## 0.21.0

UI sessions, forms and long actions (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#121).

- **Sessions (#96):** a sign-in ends after 30 minutes without activity and after 12 hours at all. Logout ends every session (a copied cookie no longer works; `Clear-Site-Data`). New on *Sicherheit*: change the UI password (ends all other sessions) and *Alle anderen Sitzungen beenden*. Changing credentials, *Neu aufsetzen* and the fetch mode ask for the password again when the sign-in is older than 15 minutes. Common passwords (a list of 10,000 plus German ones, also with digits around them) are refused for the UI password and the master passphrase.
- **Forms (#103):** the broker form comes back with what was typed (never a secret) and the error at its field (`aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`), status 422, nothing saved. Flash messages have `role="alert"`/`"status"`. The start date can't be set in the future (`max`).
- **Long actions in the background (#104):** *Neu aufsetzen*, *Logos jetzt holen* and the account check of *Prüfung* run as background jobs; *Prüfung* shows the last check with its time and *Neu prüfen*. The overview shows which broker a run is at, its step, and when it waits for an approval in the app; it refreshes every 10 s instead of 3 s and can be paused. The vault is decrypted only when its file changed; Wealthfolio's accounts and the timer's next run are kept for a minute.
- **Neu aufsetzen in two steps (#110):** a page shows how many bookings would be deleted; deleting needs the broker's name typed in. A setup checklist on the overview replaces the old "step by step" message.
- **Tables (#105):** caption, `thead`/`tbody`, `scope="col"`; checkbox labels name their booking.
- **Transfer patterns (#84):** *Überträge* is listed under *Einstellungen* again while patterns are saved, so every pattern that applies can be seen and deleted. *Duplikate* stays hidden.
- **Config under its lock (#117):** every change reads, changes and writes the config under one lock; two changes at once both stay.
- **One date parser (#119):** `model.when` for every moment from Wealthfolio or the state; a date without time zone or without time no longer breaks a broker's run.
- **Passphrase change and UI writes (#120):** writes to the sync database wait while it is re-encrypted; one that waited past the switch is refused, never lost silently.
- **Docs (#111):** README: checklist, *Überträge*, *Neu aufsetzen*, sessions, known limitations; no "self-signed" left (catalog entry, CLI help), screenshots taken anew.

## 0.20.0

Lock-out safety, concurrency and robustness, from a full audit of 15.10.2026 and the backlog (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#98, #99, #101, #105, #108, #110, #113, #115 and the audit list):

- **Bank lock-out (comdirect, FinTS):**
  - A wrong TAN in the web UI counts at once. Until now the count was lost when the login was started again.
  - The web login and the daily run can no longer overwrite each other's TAN counters.
  - A scheduled comdirect run asks for a TAN only when the web login found a push TAN, never for an unknown type.
  - Opening the login page asks the broker nothing; *Anmeldung starten* does. An open login is shown again instead of replaced, and closes after 15 minutes.
  - A PIN the bank rejects while reading depot transactions now stops further attempts like everywhere else.
- **Bookings:**
  - comdirect: a trade whose giro booking never comes is listed as unknown while it is still fetched. Until now it could silently drop out after a week.
  - comdirect: a reversed dividend is listed as unknown.
  - Deutsche Bank: a CSV the runs can't read is refused at the upload. Until now it broke every later run of the broker. German dates (`15.03.2024`) are read too.
  - The start date begins at midnight German time, not UTC.
  - Trade Republic amounts given as text keep their digits.
- **Safety and concurrency:**
  - After `brokersync-reset-password` a cookie of the old password signs in nobody, also while the web UI keeps running.
  - The web server keeps no access log, because a link can carry the setup code.
  - Switching to *Sicher* during a run also ends that run's login.
  - Each request thread has its own database connection.
  - Files are written through a temp file of their own; settings are saved under the same lock as the re-encryption.
  - The re-encryption makes its staged files durable before the journal.
  - Two quick clicks on *Jetzt abrufen* start one run.
  - A broker form is saved only when all of it is valid.
  - The Wealthfolio password is length-checked.
- **Notifications (#98):** a new ntfy topic has 128 bits and is saved at once, so it stays the same while you subscribe. A saved token can be removed. Details on ntfy.sh need an explicit confirmation.
- **Look (#105, #115, #110):**
  - Colours meet WCAG AA in light and dark (warn, OK, muted, the grey light, error in dark).
  - In English, dates are `2026-03-15` and amounts `1,234.56`.
  - *Passphrase entfernen* needs a confirmation.
- **Clean-up:** unused code removed (`get_accounts` of every adapter, `BrokerAccount`, `crypto.write_keyring`); `state.rekey` can no longer re-encrypt `state.db` in place.

## 0.19.0

Supply chain and hardening (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#88, #97, #107), from the audits of 13.10.2026:

- **Releases only after the whole CI, checked on install and update** (#88):
  - The release workflow runs every CI job on the same commit first; only its publishing step may write.
  - Each release carries the source archive, `SHA256SUMS` of every file and GitHub's build provenance (`gh attestation verify`). Published releases can't be changed any more.
  - Install and `update` check every downloaded file against the release's `SHA256SUMS`. A changed or an added file stops them, and the previous version keeps running.
  - `VERSION=0.19.0 update` installs that version, also an older one. Without it, `update` never goes back to an older version.
- **CI** (#97):
  - The test tools are locked with hashes like the runtime.
  - `pip-audit` checks the locked versions for known vulnerabilities on every change and weekly; pull requests get a dependency review.
  - Dependabot runs weekly, and also offers security updates of pytr.
  - Test coverage may not fall below 90 %.
- **Hardening** (#107):
  - The web UI answers only to its IP addresses and known names: the container's name, also with `.fritz.box`, `.lan` or `.local`, the certificate's names, the address of the notifications, and `BROKERSYNC_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Port 8090 redirects only there. This blocks DNS rebinding and open redirects.
  - Pages allow no inline styles any more (CSP without `unsafe-inline`). `/healthz` shows the version only after login.
  - comdirect: the token goes only to comdirect's own API, never to a status link on another host.
  - logo.dev: answers are read only up to the size of a logo, redirects only within logo.dev.
  - The services may only use the system calls of an ordinary service (`systemd-analyze security` 3.0 → 1.5); the daily run stops after 45 minutes at the latest.

## 0.18.0

Access and data safety (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#89, #90, #91, #106, #114), from the audits of 13.10.2026:

- **First password only with a setup code** (#89):
  - Until now anyone in the home network, and even any web page open in a browser there, could choose the UI password of a fresh installation before you.
  - The page now needs a one-time code shown only on the container's console: at the end of the installation (as a ready link), with `brokersync-cli setup-code`, and after `brokersync-reset-password`. It is valid 24 h and once; only its hash is stored, it is never logged.
  - The form carries a CSRF token like every other one.
  - *Passwort vergessen?* moved to the login page.
- **Login brake** (#90):
  - Every password check (UI password, master passphrase, setup code) is counted before the check and at most two run at once. Many parallel wrong passwords can no longer exhaust the container's memory or slip past the brake.
  - Also braked: 30 wrong attempts from all addresses together, IPv6 neighbours (same /64) count as one.
  - Behind a reverse proxy: `BROKERSYNC_TRUST_PROXY=<its address>` makes the brake count per user instead of locking everyone out.
- **Re-encryption that survives a crash** (#91):
  - Setting, changing or removing the master passphrase and the key change of an update write everything next to the old files first and then switch in one step; the database is never re-encrypted in place.
  - After a power cut in between, the next start brings the data to the old or the new state, never a mix (`brokersync-cli recover` does the same by hand).
- **Errors as pages** (#106): an expired form, an unknown page or an unexpected error show a page of the UI instead of JSON or "Internal Server Error"; an unexpected error shows only an id that is also in the log. Numbers like `Infinity` or `NaN` in a form, an unreadable CSV and odd amounts give a message instead of an error.
- **Log redaction** (#114): every new broker session replaces the old one's strings instead of piling up for as long as the service runs.

## 0.17.0

English, a light mode and a tidier overview (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#86, waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#87):

- **Einstellungen → Darstellung** (new):
  - **Sprache**: Deutsch or English. Notifications, bank texts and the comments in Wealthfolio stay as they are.
  - **Farbschema**: like the device, always light or always dark.
- **Overview**: per broker only two buttons, *Jetzt abrufen* and a gear for its settings. The reasons below the traffic light are links: "Anmeldung nötig" leads to the login, unknown bookings to *Unbekannt*, deviations to *Prüfung*.
- **Unbekannte Buchungen**: each one can be reported as a GitHub issue with one button. The issue is prefilled with type, date, version and the masked data (no IBANs or account numbers); you see and can edit everything before sending it. The raw data is folded.
- **Prüfung**: an opening position is no longer shown once its buy has been booked. The note about German time is gone.
- **Wertpapiere**: saved mappings take one line each.

## 0.16.0

Abrufmodus "Sicher" and PINs that are never stored (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#85):

- **Einstellungen → Sicherheit → Abrufmodus** - for all brokers:
  - **Automatisch**: as before; logins stay saved, the service fetches every morning.
  - **Sicher**: every fetch starts with your login (app confirmation, TAN or device code). Right after it the service logs out and deletes the session, whatever happened, so no saved login can fetch without you.
    - The daily run fetches nothing and only reminds you via ntfy.
    - Switching to *Sicher* ends all saved logins at once.
    - The lock-out guards (rejected PIN, unanswered or wrong TANs) are kept.
- **Jetzt abrufen** leads to the login first and fetches right after it.
- **Alle abrufen** leads through the logins one after the other ("Anmeldung 1 von 3", each broker can be skipped) and then fetches all together.
- **DKB and Deutsche Bank: PIN not stored.** Leave the PIN field empty and the login asks for it every time.
  - It stays in memory only until the fetch is done, never in the vault, the database or the log.
  - A saved PIN can be dropped with the new tick box below the field.

## 0.15.1

Tidier settings and overview (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#84):

- **Überträge and Duplikate are hidden for now.** Both pages are gone from *Einstellungen* and their addresses no longer answer. Transfer patterns you saved before still apply to new bookings.
- **The overview shows no amounts**: per broker only whether the balance matches Wealthfolio ("Saldo stimmt" / "Saldo weicht ab"). The details of a deviation can still be opened.
- The broker list no longer says "Scalable Capital folgt".

## 0.15.0

A new look for the web UI, made for phones (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#83):

- **Looks like Wealthfolio**: the same colours (light and dark, following the device), fonts and cards. On a phone the menu is a bar at the bottom, in reach of your thumb.
- **Overview with a traffic light per broker**: green - nothing to do; yellow - something to look at (deviations, unknown or missing bookings, no fetch for two days); red - the last fetch failed or a login is needed; grey - never fetched. Below it, only the reasons; the error message and the deviation table can be opened. The setup checklist is gone; while Wealthfolio isn't connected, a single card says so.
- **Last runs**: the last three, older ones folded away.
- **Prüfung**: everything about a broker in one card - missing bookings, positions without a buy and the account check - with a one-line summary on top. The explanations moved into "Was wird geprüft?".
- **Sicherheit**: master passphrase and certificate first; the checks as a summary ("7 von 9 in Ordnung") with only the open points shown, the rest folded. The import steps for the certificate are folded per device.

## 0.14.0

Internal restructuring for safer changes later (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#75, #76, #77). Nothing changes in what the service books or shows.

- **The database knows its version.** `state.db` now records a schema version and brings itself up to date when the service starts, step by step and in one transaction. The first step stores a savings account's balance in its own column (it was hidden in the currency field). A database written by a newer version is not opened, so an older version can't damage it.
- **Clean-up per broker is exact.** Every stored flag and value is listed in one place, with whether it belongs to a broker. *Neu aufsetzen* and removing a broker delete exactly that broker's entries; before, a pattern could also catch e.g. the logo status of an asset whose id ended in the broker's name.
- **A broker's run in named steps.** Plan the window, fetch, prepare, repair, book, compare, add tax, learn assets, check holdings, finish - in the order the documentation describes, instead of one long function.
- **The web UI in modules.** Each area (setup, overview, brokers, settings, check, duplicates, security) has its own router; the pages and addresses are the same.

## 0.13.1

Readable dates and unknown bookings (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#73):

- **One date format everywhere, in German time.** Days read `03.03.2026`, moments `03.03.2026 11:00` on every page. *Prüfung* showed Wealthfolio's activity times in UTC (one or two hours off); it now shows German time like the rest, to the second, with UTC in the tooltip. *Unbekannte Buchungen* and *Duplikate* showed ISO dates.
- **Unknown bookings without JSON.** *Unbekannte Buchungen* lists amount, security (with share count) and text in their own columns, so you can enter a booking by hand. The raw data is still there, folded, for a bug report.

## 0.13.0

Clearer web UI and stricter checks (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#69, #70, #71, #72):

- **Shorter menu.** The header now holds four entries: Übersicht, Prüfung, Unbekannt (with the number of open entries) and Einstellungen. *Einstellungen* lists Wealthfolio, Broker, Benachrichtigungen, Wertpapiere, Überträge, Logos, Sicherheit and Duplikate with a short note each; on those pages a bar below the header switches between them. The current page is marked.
- **Tables readable on phones.** On narrow screens every table row (runs, deviations, unknown bookings, the checks on *Prüfung*, duplicates, securities, transfers, security checks) is shown as a block with the column name above each value, instead of a table you have to scroll sideways.
- **Shared rules for recognising duplicates.** The cases that decide whether a booking already exists in Wealthfolio are now kept in one file the service and the import addon both test against, so both recognise the same bookings in both directions. Nothing changes in how the service matches.
- Stricter automatic checks of the code (type checks, a complexity limit, test coverage). Bookings with a missing date or share count are now reported as errors instead of failing later.

## 0.12.2

Security hardening of the web UI (#33):

- **Every form field is checked on the server**, not only in the browser: addresses (Wealthfolio, ntfy, this UI) must be http:// or https:// without credentials in them, the start date a real date not in the future, ISINs and IBANs need a valid check digit, exchanges a 4-character MIC, symbols only the usual characters, and free text is limited in length. A wrong entry is reported on the page and nothing is saved - before, e.g. a start date like "01.01.2024" was stored and made every later run fail.
- **Oversized requests are refused** (over 6 MB) before anything is read - also on the login page, which answers without a session.
- Deleting a transfer pattern with a broken form no longer ends in an error page; a new session is started when the UI password is first set.
- `SECURITY.md` lists the security libraries and measures the service uses, and why some common ones aren't needed.

## 0.12.1

Security hardening from the audit (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#55):

- **Dependencies only at locked, hash-checked versions.** Install and update used to fetch the newest version of every dependency from PyPI; a tampered or broken release would have landed in the container unseen, next to the bank credentials. Now `requirements.txt` holds each one at an exact version with its hashes (for every supported Python and platform), `setup.sh` installs only those, only as ready-built packages, and the CI tests exactly them. Dependabot proposes updates.
- **The install engine is pinned.** The install and `update` load community-scripts' engine, which runs as root on the Proxmox host, from a reviewed commit instead of its moving main branch; a weekly check reports newer ones.
- **Error texts are masked on the pages too.** A bank's or broker's error message shown on the overview (or Wealthfolio's on the other pages) no longer shows IBANs, account numbers or stored secrets - as in the log and the notifications. The log no longer lists request addresses.
- Backups are created readable for root only from the first byte.
- A secret just saved is masked in the log at once, not only after the next read.
- Repository: secret scan of the whole history in the CI, `.gitignore` for keys and data, GitHub Actions pinned to commits, `SECURITY.md` for private reports.

## 0.12.0

- **Logos for securities (optional, page *Logos*).** Wealthfolio's own logos are named by ticker and exchange, so securities booked under their ISIN show none. Turned on and with a (free) logo.dev key, the service asks logo.dev for each security by ISIN after every run and sets the logo as the security's custom logo in Wealthfolio (version 3.8.0 or later) - stored in Wealthfolio's database, so it survives updates and is part of its backups. Only ISINs go to logo.dev. A logo you set yourself is never replaced; one you remove isn't set again; a security logo.dev has no logo for is asked again after 30 days. At most 50 questions per run.

## 0.11.5

- **Fix: an opening position entered from the old parser's ISIN still stayed unmatched.** Its Wealthfolio asset counted as taken by that spelling (`<ISIN>|/DE/<WKN>`) - which is the same ISIN. It isn't taken from the real ISIN any more.
- **The log masked ISINs** of US securities ("US***"): long digit runs after letters (an ISIN) are no longer taken for account numbers; account, depot and reference numbers still are.
- ISINs assigned on the page *Wertpapiere* are no longer looked up in imported trades every run (the holdings check finds them by symbol).

## 0.11.4

- **Fix: an opening position entered from holdings read before 0.9.9 wasn't found by the holdings check.** python-fints' parser, used until then, read a security split over two lines as ISIN `<ISIN>|/DE/<WKN>` and kept only the name's last line (Deutsche Bank: "IEN O.N."). An opening entered from it was booked under that ISIN. Its transaction now carries the real ISIN (its id stays, so nothing is booked again), and the check finds the position.
- **The log says why a position's Wealthfolio asset couldn't be found**: no purchase or sale whose transfer names the ISIN, its asset already belonging to another ISIN, transfers naming several ISINs, or statements naming several assets - asset ids and ISINs only.
- An ISIN whose statements name several assets is now also tried by time and amount.

## 0.11.3

- **Fix: two ETFs of a savings plan were mixed up.** A PDF import ends a trade and its transfers with the same statement reference (`[PDF …]`); that now ties them together exactly, before time and amount are tried. It also corrects an asset an earlier version learned wrongly: positions that deviated in the last check are looked at again, and what a statement says replaces the stored asset.
- **Fix: a position booked by the service itself (an opening position) stayed unmatched** when another asset was stored for its ISIN. For a deviating position, the trade whose transfer names the ISIN with the same amount and time - the service's own as well as an import's - now replaces the stored asset.
- The log names the stored Wealthfolio asset of every deviating position, to see at once why it doesn't fit.

## 0.11.2

- **Fix: positions of a savings plan stayed unmatched.** The executions of a savings plan are booked in the same second, so the transfers next to a trade named several ISINs and 0.11.1 learned nothing for them. A trade's transfer is now also told apart by its amount, and what is learned narrows the rest in the same run.
- The log names imported trades before the bank history only when new ones get their money (not the same count every run).

## 0.11.1

- **Fix: positions bought only by an import were reported as missing.** The holdings check finds a position's Wealthfolio asset through the activities the service booked or matched. Trades a PDF/CSV import booked on its own (e.g. all DKB statements from before the giro history) were unknown, so every position showed up twice: at the bank, and under the import's ticker in Wealthfolio. Now, for a position whose asset is still unknown, the service looks for imported purchases and sales whose cash transfer names the ISIN ("Funds for <ISIN> …", "<ISIN> (…) sale"), and learns their asset - only when the ISIN is on one asset only, and only for a valid ISIN (check digit).

## 0.11.0

- **Imported trades older than the bank history get their money (FinTS banks, e.g. DKB).** A purchase a CSV/PDF import booked before the first day of the giro history the service read was paid from money the service never saw: the cash account went negative. Now every run adds, for each such import:
  - a purchase: a deposit of its cost just before its transfer to the depot,
  - a sale: a withdrawal of its proceeds just after,
  - a dividend: nothing - its money stays on the cash account.
  
  Trades in the read history aren't touched (their giro booking was read and matched), nor the service's own activities. The first day read is now recorded for every FinTS bank (`history-start`); where it wasn't yet, the first successful run tells (its start date, else 89 days before it).
- **FinTS depot transactions (diagnosis):** asked for the last 89 days (as far back as banks answer without a TAN), not just the run's window.

## 0.10.2

- **FinTS depot transactions, first step (diagnosis, nothing booked).** Banks that offer depot transactions over FinTS (DKB) are asked for them (HKWDU, answered in MT536 - python-fints knows neither, the service defines both). The log names, per depot, how many came and what they would be booked as (purchase, sale, delivery, corporate action, reversal), how complete they are, and the answer's layout - counts, field names and standard codes only, no ISINs, amounts or numbers. Booking follows once a real answer has been checked.
  - Not asked when the bank wants a TAN for them; a failure never stops the run.

## 0.10.1

- **Fix (FinTS depot holdings): "'NoneType' object is not subscriptable".** python-fints takes the bank's country from the account's BIC when it asks for the holdings. A depot listed only in the user parameters (DKB) has no BIC, so the request failed before it was sent. It now gets the BIC of the bank's other accounts (else one naming Germany).

## 0.10.0

- **Tagesgeld as a Wealthfolio account of its own (FinTS banks, e.g. DKB).** In the broker settings, an optional third Wealthfolio account can be assigned to the bank's savings account. The service then also reads its bookings and balance:
  - Interest, deposits and withdrawals of the Tagesgeld are booked on that account; its balance is compared with it after each run.
  - A transfer between the giro account and the Tagesgeld is booked once, as a transfer pair (TRANSFER_OUT/TRANSFER_IN with one `sourceGroupId`), not as a withdrawal plus a deposit. Transfers the giro side booked before the Tagesgeld was assigned get their Tagesgeld side on their own.
  - The first run with the Tagesgeld reads it from the start date (without one: the last 89 days); so does a run after another account was chosen.
  - The Tagesgeld is found by its name or account type; where that fails, its IBAN can be entered with the credentials.
- The giro account is no longer taken from an account named like a savings account, even when the bank reports both with the same account type (DKB).

## 0.9.9

- **FinTS depot holdings: own MT535 parser and a readable log.** python-fints' parser fails on a holding without a total value and only knows share counts in one notation, and the service logged a failed holdings request at debug level only. So a depot could come back empty without a word (DKB in 0.9.8). Now:
  - Holdings are read by the service's own, more tolerant parser (shares or nominal, value from price × shares when the bank sends no total).
  - Only accounts the bank offers holdings for are asked (not the giro or savings account).
  - The log says per depot how many positions came, why none could be read, and for an empty answer its layout (field names only, no values or numbers).

## 0.9.8

- **DKB: depot holdings.** The DKB delivers the depot's holdings over FinTS (the depot has no IBAN and is only listed in the user parameters). After each run they are compared with the DKB depot account in Wealthfolio, and a position missing there can be entered on *Prüfung* as an opening position. Depot transactions still come from a PDF import of the statements.
- **Unknown events keep no account or depot numbers.** IBANs and long numbers (account, depot, reference) in their texts are masked before they are stored, for every broker. Events stored before are masked at their next update; an unmatched securities booking is updated by every run. ISINs, dates and amounts stay.

## 0.9.7

- **Fix: dividends stay on the cash account.** 0.9.4 followed a dividend whose giro booking wasn't read (a Deutsche Bank CSV row older than the giro history) with a withdrawal of the same amount, so the money left the cash account right away. A dividend now always stays there, `external_cash` or not; purchases and sales are unchanged.
- Withdrawals booked that way before stay in Wealthfolio. Remove them by hand (comment "… paid out [SYNC deutschebank:…]"), or use *Neu aufsetzen* for the broker: it books everything again, uploaded CSV rows and opening positions are kept.

## 0.9.6

- **Fix (FinTS camt): "Abrufzeitraum außerhalb des unterstützten Bereichs".** A bank states in its parameters how many days of camt bookings it keeps (Deutsche Bank). The service now asks only that far back, and the log says so ("die Bank hält camt-Umsätze N Tage vor"). Older giro bookings aren't available over FinTS at all.

## 0.9.5

- **Fix (Deutsche Bank): the camt request was refused.**
  - The bank answered "9210 Eindeutige Identifikation des Kontos nicht möglich - Angaben zur nationalen Kontoverbindung erforderlich".
  - The reason: python-fints names the account by IBAN and BIC only in camt requests.
  - The service now adds account number, sub-account and bank code, which FinTS provides for in the same field.
- **Readable bank errors (FinTS).** Instead of the whole technical answer, the overview and the notification say "Die Deutsche Bank meldet: 9210 …" with the bank's codes and texts.

## 0.9.4

- **Fix (FinTS, Deutsche Bank): without an IBAN the wrong account was read.** The service took the first account with an IBAN, at the Deutsche Bank the savings account, so the giro account's bookings never came. It now picks the giro account by the account type the bank reports, and the log says which one (`Umsätze und Saldo von „…“`). An IBAN entered in the settings still decides.
- **Deutsche Bank: giro bookings as camt.** The bank answers the MT940 request with nothing. When a bank does that and offers camt, the service reads camt instead; the log says how many bookings came which way.
- **Deutsche Bank: depot transactions from the CSV export.** FinTS doesn't deliver them, so the export of the depot's transactions can be uploaded in the broker settings, again and again, overlapping without duplicates; depot and account numbers aren't stored. What gets booked:
  - dividends with their taxes;
  - buys and sales, paid via the cash account; the giro bookings that settle them are matched in the same run;
  - deliveries against payment (*Eingang*, e.g. employee shares) as a buy whose money came from outside;
  - rows older than the giro history the service read, without money on the cash account;
  - corporate actions and depot transfers are listed under *Unbekannte Buchungen*.
- A dividend whose money went outside the broker's two accounts gets a withdrawal after its transfer (as a sale already did).
- Page *Sicherheit*: the import instructions warn against Windows' automatic certificate store, and say to restart the browser after the import.

## 0.9.3

- **Trusted HTTPS instead of a browser warning.** The container now has a small certificate authority of its own. It signs the web UI's certificate, and the next update replaces the self-signed one from 0.9.0. Import the CA certificate once (page *Sicherheit* → *CA-Zertifikat herunterladen*; instructions for Windows, macOS, Firefox, iPhone and Android are on the page). After that the browser shows the UI as secure, also after every renewal. The CA may only vouch for local names (private IP ranges, the container's name, `.local`, `.lan`, `.home.arpa`, `.fritz.box`): even with its key, nobody could fake a public site with it. Its key stays root-only and is never handed to the service. The certificate leaves out public IPv6 addresses.

## 0.9.2

- **Fix:** `brokersync-cli security-status` reported the web UI as plain HTTP although it runs on HTTPS; the command now knows the service's setting.

## 0.9.1

- **A fresh key, once.** 0.9.0 moved the existing key from `data/secret.key` to `/etc/wealthfolio-broker-sync` instead of replacing it. Backups from before the update, or Proxmox backups, that held that key could still open the current data. The update now creates a new key once and re-encrypts everything for it; copies of the old key open nothing any more. With a master passphrase the service has to be unlocked before the update, otherwise the next update does it.
- **Fix: older backups holding the key were not replaced.** The check never matched (`tar | grep -q` under `pipefail`). They are now deleted and replaced by one backup of the encrypted data.
- **The update no longer hangs.** Steps that go through systemd (`systemd-creds`, the migration) have time limits. Running `deploy/setup.sh` by hand restarts a running service with the new files.

## 0.9.0

- **Everything the service stores is encrypted, and the key is no longer next to the data** (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#53).
  - Credentials, sessions and tokens: AES-256-GCM instead of Fernet (`secrets.enc`).
  - Settings, which include your own IBANs in the transfer patterns: `config.enc` instead of a plain `config.json`.
  - ntfy settings, including the topic, which is a secret on ntfy.sh: `notify.enc`.
  - Sync database: SQLCipher (AES-256).
  - The key moves from `data/secret.key` to `/etc/wealthfolio-broker-sync/key.cred`, encrypted with `systemd-creds`; the services get it from systemd at start. A copy of `data/`, or one of the update backups, is useless without it.
  - The update migrates everything once and replaces older backups that still held the key.
- **Optional master passphrase** (new page *Sicherheit*): the data key is then derived from the service key and your passphrase (argon2id). Not even a full copy of the container opens the data without the passphrase. After a restart the service has to be unlocked in the web UI; until then it fetches nothing and says so via ntfy. Without the passphrase the data is lost.
- **HTTPS for the web UI:**
  - The UI now runs on `https://<ip>:8443` with a self-signed certificate that is created and renewed automatically. A certificate of your own in `/etc/wealthfolio-broker-sync/tls/` is kept.
  - `http://<ip>:8090` redirects there, and links in notifications are switched to the new address.
  - Cookies are `Secure`, with `SameSite=strict` and a 24 h lifetime; strict security headers (CSP without scripts, no framing, HSTS).
- **Web UI password:**
  - It is now hashed with argon2id instead of scrypt; existing passwords are upgraded at the next login.
  - New passwords need at least 12 characters.
  - After five wrong attempts, logins from that client pause for 15 minutes.
  - `brokersync-reset-password` also signs everyone out.
- **Nothing sensitive in the log or in notifications:**
  - Credentials, tokens, IBANs and long account numbers are masked in the log and in messages on screen.
  - ntfy messages carry only the title and a link unless *Details* is switched on under *Benachrichtigungen*.
- **Hardened services:** no capabilities, private `/dev` and `/tmp`, kernel and namespace restrictions, and only `data/` writable (mode 0700, files 0600).
- New commands:
  - `brokersync-cli <command>` runs a command as the service user with the key, e.g. `brokersync-cli security-status`.
  - `brokersync make-cert` and `brokersync migrate` are used by the installation and the update.

## 0.8.0

- **Deutsche Bank** (FinTS): the giro account like DKB's (deposits, withdrawals, transfers, interest, fees; securities bookings are only checked against an import of the statements) and the **holdings of the maxblue depot**, compared with the depot account after each run - positions without a buy in Wealthfolio can be entered as opening positions on *Prüfung*. Login with the Deutsche Bank ID (or branch and account number), PIN and the bank code of the branch; confirmation with BestSign in the app. New and not yet tried against the bank: at login the log lists what it offers over FinTS (transactions, camt, holdings, depot transactions; per account its product name and type, no numbers) - that decides how depot trades are booked next.
- FinTS (all banks): a depot listed among the accounts no longer gets picked as the giro account when no IBAN is set; holdings are also asked for depots that have no IBAN.

## 0.7.4

- **Docs and UI texts describe the service on its own.** README, ARCHITECTURE and the pages of the web UI no longer point to another tool; CSV and PDF imports are mentioned only as activities the sync recognises and doesn't book twice. The message about an unmatched securities booking now says to import the securities statement (PDF) in Wealthfolio. Bookings are unchanged.

## 0.7.3

- **Tax for dividends from the CSV import.** Scalable's CSV export has no tax on dividends, so dividends the addon imported had none. When the sync finds such a dividend for a broker's payout that carries a tax, it puts the tax into the imported activity - only the tax field; amount and comment stay, and tax is not part of Wealthfolio's duplicate fingerprint, so a later re-import still recognises it. Dividends matched before this version get it once: the first run after the update fetches the details of those transactions again (for Scalable a few minutes, paced for its rate limit). The log says how many dividends got their tax.

## 0.7.2

- **Fix: comdirect returned only half a year without a start date.** Unasked, comdirect's API delivers about six months of giro bookings (and possibly depot transactions); older ones only when a date is given. Without a start date the service now asks for ten years back, giro and depot alike; if comdirect refuses the date, it asks without.

## 0.7.1

- **Fix: "Neu aufsetzen" wasn't visible** in the broker settings - it had landed in the page title.
- **comdirect without a start date fetches everything** comdirect's API delivers (before: one year). The log shows how far back that goes (oldest giro booking and depot transaction), without amounts.

## 0.7.0

- **comdirect: only the depot is booked, no longer the giro account.** The comdirect cash account in Wealthfolio now receives only the dividends. A buy is booked with a deposit of its cost on the cash account right before it, a sale with a withdrawal of its proceeds right after it - so the account doesn't run into the minus because the giro history before the start date is missing. Deposits, card payments, fees and interest of the giro account are no longer booked, and its balance is no longer compared. After the update click **Neu aufsetzen** in the comdirect settings once: it deletes what 0.6.0 booked and the next run books everything again with the new rules.
- **Opening positions:** positions the broker holds that Wealthfolio has no buy for (bought before the start date, or transferred in) are listed on the page *Prüfung*. Enter the purchase date, price per unit (pre-filled with the broker's purchase price, if it reports one) and fees: the next run books a buy on that day, preceded by a deposit of its cost.
- **Neu aufsetzen** (broker settings): deletes every activity the service booked for a broker (`[SYNC …]` in its two accounts; imports and manual entries stay), forgets its sync state and fetches everything from the start date again. Confirmation required.

## 0.6.0

- **New broker: comdirect**, through comdirect's official REST API for private customers (giro account and depot). Login with Zugangsnummer, PIN and the API's client ID and secret, confirmed with photoTAN-Push in the app (or a photoTAN graphic / mobileTAN typed in the web UI); a scheduled run asks via ntfy and waits. Balance, giro bookings, depot positions and depot transactions are read; buys and sales are booked with the giro booking that settled them (its amount is the trade's cash, the rest of it the costs - the API doesn't split costs of a sale into fee and tax), dividends when the posting text names the security. Depot transfers and trades whose settlement doesn't turn up are reported.
- **Lock-out guard for comdirect:** comdirect locks the online banking after five TAN requests without a correct TAN and after three wrong TANs. The service stops after three unanswered requests or two wrong TANs and asks the user to log in once on comdirect.de and save the credentials again.
- The login page can show a picture with the challenge (comdirect's photoTAN graphic).

## 0.5.1

- **Prüfung: fewer false alarms.** Two moments on the securities account that cancel each other within 36 hours now count as one and are no longer listed - e.g. a dividend from the CSV import and its transfer to cash from a PDF import or entered by hand at another time of day. A stock dividend or staking reward (subtype `DIVIDEND_IN_KIND`, `STAKING_REWARD`) brings shares, not money, and no longer counts as cash on the securities account.

## 0.5.0

- **Wealthfolio is checked after every run, not trusted from the sync's own records.** Until now a transaction counted as done once the sync had booked it; deleting it in Wealthfolio meant it never came back. Now every run compares the transactions synced before with Wealthfolio (by their `[SYNC …]` reference and the stored activity ids) and lists on the page *Prüfung*, per broker: transactions that are missing in Wealthfolio, completely or partly, with **Wieder anlegen** (the next run books them, unless an import has them by then) and **Ignorieren** (they stay away; *Doch anlegen* undoes it). A deletion may have been on purpose, so nothing is re-created without that click. New deviations are notified once.
- **Scalable reads its whole history on every run** (from the start date): a few paged queries; the per-transaction details are still fetched only once. So the comparison also finds activities of the sync that Scalable no longer lists - e.g. a distribution Scalable cancelled after it was booked. They are listed for deletion in Wealthfolio, never deleted by the sync. *Ab Startdatum neu abrufen* is no longer needed for Scalable and hidden there.
- Scalable: a cancelled distribution and its original now always cancel out; the cancellation is no longer an unknown event, and its old entry disappears from *Unbekannte Buchungen*.

## 0.4.5

- **New page "Prüfung"** (read only): for each broker it shows where the two-account model doesn't add up - the moments on the securities account where cash is left behind (e.g. a buy without its funding transfer, or a transfer whose sale or payout was deleted), and transfers between the two accounts without their other leg. Each line has date, type, amount, comment and whether the sync or an import booked it. Nothing is changed; fixes are made in Wealthfolio.

## 0.4.4

- **Fix: a certificate redemption was booked as a dividend next to the CSV import's sale.** Scalable books a redemption or knock-out as the securities leaving the depot with value 0 plus a distribution of the same ISIN on the same day; the addon books both as one sale. The sync now does the same, so it recognises the CSV sale instead of adding a dividend.
- **Fund swaps** (securities `SWAP_OUT` plus the cash `SWAP_OUT` of the same ISIN and day) are booked as a sale like the addon, instead of being reported as unknown.
- **A cancelled distribution** and its original cancel out, like in the addon. If the sync had booked the original already, the cancellation is still reported, so the original can be removed by hand.
- Activities booked before this version are not changed: a dividend the sync added for a redemption has to be deleted by hand.

## 0.4.3

- **Fix: a full Scalable fetch stopped with "RATE_LIMITED".** Scalable limits how many transaction details may be queried in a short time. The adapter now pauses a second between detail queries, waits and retries when Scalable reports the limit (30 s, 60 s, 120 s, or as long as Scalable says), and only queries details of transactions the sync doesn't have yet. If the limit lasts, the run books everything it has the details for and reports the remaining trades ("Details folgen beim nächsten Abruf"); the next run continues with those.
- The journal now carries the reason of a failed run, not only its status.

## 0.4.2

- **Fix: Scalable brought no transactions and no cash balance.** The CLI's broker commands wrap their answer in `result` (next to the account and portfolio they used); the adapter read one level too high and found nothing. It now reads the answer like `sc` itself does. After the update, click *Ab Startdatum neu abrufen* in the Scalable settings, so the next run fetches the history the earlier runs missed.

## 0.4.1

- **"Ab Startdatum neu abrufen"** in the broker settings: the next run fetches everything from the start date again, once. Changing the start date alone only affects a broker's first run; afterwards each run starts at the last successful one (minus 7 days). Transactions already synced are not created again.
- Each run now logs how many transactions the broker returned since when, and how many were new.
- Scalable: the log shows what `sc` returned - transactions by type, status and subtype - and, when the cash balance is missing, the structure of the answer instead (field names and types, no amounts, ids or names). This helps to find out why a run brings nothing.

## 0.4.0

- **New broker: Scalable Capital**, through Scalable's official command line [Scalable CLI](https://github.com/ScalableCapital/scalable-cli) (`sc`) instead of the web app's internal API. Enable it once in Scalable's web platform under *Profil → Sicherheit → Agentic Investing*; log in from the service's page with a link and a code confirmed in the browser. The CLI runs in read-only mode and only read commands are used.
- Trades, savings plans, distributions, interest, taxes, fees, deposits and withdrawals are booked like the addon's Scalable CSV import, so CSV-imported activities are recognised. A depot migration that moves positions out and back in is skipped; cancellations, single security transfers, fund swaps and ELTIFs are reported as unknown. Positions and cash are checked against Wealthfolio after each run.
- The CLI's session is kept encrypted in the vault and renews itself; when Scalable asks for a new login, the daily run sends the link by ntfy and waits ten minutes for the confirmation.
- Install and update fetch `sc` from Scalable's GitHub release (`brokersync install-sc`) and install it only when Scalable's minisign signature and the checksum are valid. If that fails, everything except Scalable keeps working.
- A dividend without a share count is booked with quantity 1, like the addon does for Scalable.

## 0.3.8

- Internal: the FinTS part of the DKB adapter is now a shared `FintsAdapter`, so further FinTS banks (Deutsche Bank, comdirect as a fallback) only need a short profile ([importer-addon#44](https://github.com/waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon/issues/44)). DKB behaves exactly as before: same transaction ids, same messages, same settings.
- A bank whose bank code differs per branch gets a *Bankleitzahl* field; a TAN to type in (instead of a confirmation in the app) is asked for in the web UI.

## 0.3.7

- **The test broker "Dummy" is gone.** With Trade Republic and DKB there are real brokers to try the service with, and the dummy did harm: set up on the same Wealthfolio accounts as a real broker, it booked its test transactions there (a fake position, cash too high) and left permanent "unknown" events.
- On the first start after the update, its settings, saved login, sync state, runs, unknown events and holdings check are removed; the other brokers are untouched. What it booked in Wealthfolio stays - the overview says once how many activities that are and how to find them (comment `[SYNC dummy:`), so you can delete them yourself.
- The tests use a test-only broker under `tests/` instead, which isn't installed.
- README screenshots show Trade Republic instead of the dummy.

## 0.3.6

- **Fix: the transfers between securities and cash account moved no money.** Every cash activity was created with the asset `$CASH-<ccy>`, and Wealthfolio books a TRANSFER_IN/TRANSFER_OUT with an asset as a *securities* transfer of that asset. So a buy was paid from the securities account's own cash, sale proceeds and dividends stayed there, the cash account was short by the same amount and showed a position "$CASH". Cash activities now carry no asset, like the addon's imports.
- **Existing installations are repaired automatically:** the first run of each broker after the update removes the `$CASH` asset from the sync's own activities in Wealthfolio (updated in place, not deleted and created again); Wealthfolio then recalculates the portfolio. Until that has worked the broker books nothing, the run is reported as failed and the next one tries again.
- The holdings check now also reports cash on the securities account (it should be 0) and any "$CASH" position, on either account.

## 0.3.5

- **Fix: the holdings check listed every position twice** - once with the broker's shares and Wealthfolio 0, once with 0 and Wealthfolio's shares. Wealthfolio's holdings carry no ISIN and the addon books under the ticker the user mapped, so the check compared the ISIN with the ticker. The sync now learns which Wealthfolio asset an ISIN is booked under from the activities of its trades and dividends (its own or the CSV/PDF ones it recognised) and compares positions by that asset.
- New trades and dividends of a known ISIN are booked onto that asset, instead of opening a second position under the ISIN.
- Unknown Trade Republic events now show their amount (`betrag`) on the page *Unbekannte Buchungen*, so they can be booked by hand; events already listed get it with the next run.
- After this update, the next run of a broker with positions (Trade Republic) fetches the whole history once to learn the assets; nothing already in Wealthfolio is booked again.

## 0.3.4

- **Fix: "Jetzt abrufen" did nothing for a broker with "Automatisch abrufen" off.** Each broker now has its own "Jetzt abrufen" button on the status page, which runs it even when automatic fetching is off; the general button is now "Alle abrufen" and, like the daily run, skips those brokers (the page says so). The status of such a broker shows its last result plus "automatischer Abruf aus" instead of only "aus".
- After removing duplicates, the holdings/cash check on the status page is discarded (it was computed with the duplicates) and recomputed by the broker's next run; the message says to click "Jetzt abrufen".

## 0.3.3

- **Fix: removing duplicates stopped after the first transfer leg.** Wealthfolio deletes both legs of a linked transfer pair when one is deleted; deleting the second leg then failed ("not found") and aborted the whole removal. The partner leg is now skipped, "not found" counts as removed, and one transaction failing no longer stops the others - the page lists what couldn't be removed.
- Logging in to a broker whose saved session is still valid now says so ("die gespeicherte Sitzung ist noch gültig, eine Bestätigung war nicht nötig") instead of a bare "angemeldet", which looked as if nothing had happened.

## 0.3.2

- **Fix: trades and dividends imported by CSV were booked a second time.** The check against existing activities required the same symbol, but the addon books a security under the ticker the user mapped, the sync under the ISIN. A trade now also matches with another symbol when share count, amount (±0.02) and time (≤36 h) agree; a dividend when it is the only candidate.
- **New page "Duplikate":** lists the activities the sync created although the CSV/PDF import already had them, side by side, and - after confirmation - deletes only the sync's copies (with their transfer legs). The transaction is then marked as existing and not created again.
- **Fix: Trade Republic positions were read as empty.** Trade Republic groups them in categories now (`categories[].positions[]`, field `isin`); the holdings check showed every position as 0 at Trade Republic.

## 0.3.1

- Updates can no longer leave the service unable to start: the update keeps the previous Python environment until the new one is completely installed, puts it back if the install fails (network, disk, a broken package), restarts the previous version and says so. Before, a failed install left no environment at all and the service restarted in a loop ("Unable to locate executable .../venv/bin/brokersync").

## 0.3.0

- **Trade Republic** (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#38), read-only via pytr 0.4.10: web login confirmed in the Trade Republic app (or with an authenticator code) without logging out the phone; the session is kept and resumed, and a scheduled run asks for a new confirmation via ntfy when it has expired. Timeline events are booked like the addon's CSV import: trades and savings plans with fee and tax, dividends net with withholding tax, Saveback as a bonus-funded buy, interest, Vorabpauschale, tax corrections, deposits, card payments and refunds, transfers (with transfer patterns). Corporate actions, securities transfers and private markets are reported for the CSV import; informational and cancelled events are skipped.
- **Holdings check** after every run (all brokers): the broker's cash and - for Trade Republic and the dummy - positions against Wealthfolio's holdings, shown on the status page and reported via ntfy when a deviation lasts two runs.
- The dummy reports its positions, so the check can be tried with it.

## 0.2.1

- The web UI shows the installed version in the header, next to the name (previously only in the footer).

## 0.2.0

- **DKB** (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#37): giro account via FinTS (python-fints), read-only. Balance and transactions; confirmation in the DKB app in the web UI, or with a ntfy message and a few minutes' wait during the daily run. Deposits, card payments/withdrawals, interest and fees are booked on the DKB cash account; outbound transfers to own accounts become transfers via the new *Überträge* page (transfer patterns as in the addon).
- Giro bookings for depot trades and payouts aren't booked again: the sync checks that the addon's PDF import booked them and reports the ones still missing until it has.
- The status page shows the broker's balance after each run, for comparison with Wealthfolio.
- After a rejected PIN the service doesn't contact the bank again until the credentials are saved anew, so the online banking isn't locked.

## 0.1.3

- The status page shows the real state of the sync: "läuft" only while a sync actually holds the lock (from the web UI or the timer), and it refreshes itself every 3 seconds until the sync is done.
- Runs left at "läuft" by a process that ended in the middle of a sync (restart, update, crash) are closed as "abgebrochen" instead of staying "läuft" forever.
- A sync started while the status page checks the lock waits a moment instead of being skipped.

## 0.1.2

- Dummy test data is easy to find and remove in Wealthfolio: its transactions are dated on the day of the login to the dummy (a few hours before it, German time) and marked TEST in every comment (`TEST Kauf …`, ids `TEST-<date>-<n>`). The date is fixed at the login, so the daily timer doesn't book a new set every day; logging in to the dummy again on another day books a new one.

## 0.1.1

- Install with one line in the Proxmox shell instead of PVE Scripts Local: its catalog only lists scripts from the official community-scripts database, so a custom repository never showed up there. The container script now loads the community-scripts engine (`community-scripts/core`) with this repository as script source, so the install script and the container's `update` command come from here.

## 0.1.0

First version: the base of the service (waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon#36), with a dummy broker to try it end to end. DKB, Trade Republic and Scalable Capital follow as their own adapters (#37–#39).

- Adapter interface `get_accounts` / `get_positions` / `get_transactions(since)` / `get_cash`, read-only, with a two-step login for TAN/app confirmation.
- Booking rules of the Broker Importer addon: two-account model, transfer pairs with `sourceGroupId`, `amount = tradeFinalCash`, fee and tax in their own fields, tax refunds as CREDIT/TAX_REFUND.
- Deduplication: sync state, Wealthfolio's duplicate fingerprint, and a check against activities the addon already imported from CSV or PDF (same as its `matchExisting`). An interrupted run is completed by the next one.
- Web UI with setup assistant, status per broker, "Jetzt abrufen", broker login with TAN, ntfy settings, security mappings, list of unknown event types.
- Credentials encrypted (Fernet, key file 0600), web UI behind its own password.
- Daily systemd timer; ntfy notifications with a link when a TAN is due, a login expired or a broker failed.
- One-click install and update through PVE Scripts Local (community-scripts layout `ct/`, `install/`, `json/`); updates keep configuration and credentials and back them up first.
